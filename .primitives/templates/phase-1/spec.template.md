**What This Document Does NOT Define**:
- How to implement (that's architecture)
- User interface designs (that's UX/UI)
- Non-functional requirements (those are in the constitution)

**Who Uses This Document**:
- Product managers for scope understanding
- Architects for system design

- Track priority changes and update spec
- Validate user stories against acceptance criteria
- Ensure MVP scope is clearly marked

### For Architects
- Design system to fulfill all requirements
- Flag any requirements that are infeasible
- Ensure architecture supports all integrations
- Validate data model against data requirements

### For Developers
- Implement requirements exactly as specified
- Question ambiguous requirements before coding
- Write tests based on acceptance criteria
- Update spec if clarifications are needed

### For Testers
- Create test cases from acceptance criteria
- Verify business rules are enforced
- Test all edge cases and error conditions
- Validate integrations against specifications

### For Business Analysts
- Keep requirements updated as changes occur
- Maintain traceability to Phase 0
- Resolve open questions
- Facilitate stakeholder reviews

---

**Remember**: This spec defines WHAT the system does, not HOW it does it. Keep requirements implementation-independent. If you find yourself describing algorithms or data structures, move that to the architecture document.

**Requirement Quality**: Good requirements are clear, testable, atomic, feasible, and traceable. If a requirement doesn't meet these criteria, refine it before approval.

**Changes**: All requirement changes must go through change control process. Update traceability when changes occur. Notify all affected parties (architects, developers, testers).
