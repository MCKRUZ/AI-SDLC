## Interview Transcript

**Interviewer**: Linda, thanks for making time for this follow-up. Since our first conversation, we've learned a lot from Tom and Alex that has people implications. I want to walk through those with you.

**Linda Park**: Of course. I heard about Tom's interview - the support team situation sounds worse than I realized. And Alex mentioned flight risk in his team?

**Interviewer**: Yes. Let me summarize what we learned, then get your perspective.

From Tom: Support team has 10 people, 30% attrition in 18 months, burned out, will need 4-6 additional staff plus $2-3M in contractors. Only 1 of 10 has manufacturing background.

From Alex: IT team has 25% at flight risk - 5 of 20 people including Kevin, his infrastructure lead. Needs $3-4M in contractors. 

Total contractor budget is now $5-7M. Timeline is 36-48 months. Overall budget is $21.5-30.5M.

**Linda**: [pauses] Okay. That's... that's a lot more complex than we discussed last time. Let me think through the people implications.

**Interviewer**: Let's start with support team hiring. Tom said he needs 4-6 more support staff. What's realistic for hiring that many people?

**Linda**: Let me break this down carefully because it's not just "post job, hire people."

**Finding the Right Candidates:**

Support roles in manufacturing are different from typical IT support. Tom mentioned only 1 of his 10 people has manufacturing background. That's actually typical - most IT support people come from traditional IT, not manufacturing.

But for manufacturing support, you really need people who:
1. Understand manufacturing workflows and pressures
2. Don't panic when someone calls at 2 AM saying production is down
3. Can talk to floor workers in their language
4. Understand the business impact of technical issues

Those people are rare. You're not going to find 4-6 of them locally.

**Interviewer**: How long would it take to hire 4-6 people with that profile?

**Linda**: Honestly? **12-18 months to get all 4-6 hired and productive.** Here's why:

**Months 1-3: Sourcing and screening**
- Write job descriptions (emphasize manufacturing experience)
- Post on manufacturing IT job boards (not just Indeed)
- Work with recruiters who specialize in manufacturing IT
- Screen applicants - probably see 50-100 resumes per opening
- Most won't have manufacturing background - that's the filter

**Months 4-6: Interviewing and offers**
- Phone screens (30-40 candidates)
- Technical interviews (10-15 per role)
- Cultural fit interviews (Tom needs to be involved)
- Make offers (expect 20-30% decline rate for manufacturing IT roles)
- Negotiate compensation

**Months 7-9: Onboarding first hires**
- Background checks, drug testing (manufacturing requirement)
- Onboarding process (2-4 weeks)
- System training (3-4 months to be productive)
- Manufacturing floor training (2-3 months to understand workflows)

**Months 10-12: Onboarding later hires**
- Hire and onboard remaining staff
- Stagger hiring so Tom's team isn't overwhelmed with training

**Realistically, you'll have 2-3 people hired and productive by month 9, the rest by month 15-18.**

And that assumes we can find them. Manufacturing IT support people are in demand. We're competing with other manufacturers, and we're not in a major metro area.

**Interviewer**: What about compensation for these roles?

**Linda**: Support roles with manufacturing experience command premium:

**Level 1 Support (entry-level)**:
- Standard IT support: $40-50K
- With manufacturing experience: $50-60K
- We'd need 2-3 at this level

**Level 2 Support (experienced)**:
- Standard IT support: $60-75K
- With manufacturing experience: $75-90K
- We'd need 2-3 at this level

**Total annual cost for 4-6 new staff: $300-450K per year**

Plus recruiting costs - if we use recruiters (which we'll need to for manufacturing-specific talent), that's 20-25% of first year salary as fee. So add $60-110K in recruiting fees.

And Tom mentioned $2-3M for contractors while we're hiring and training. That's necessary - you can't just wait 12-18 months with inadequate support.

**Interviewer**: What about finding contractors with manufacturing background?

**Linda**: Even harder than hiring permanent staff. 

**Contractor Challenges:**

Most IT contractors specialize in traditional IT - banks, insurance, healthcare. Manufacturing contractors are niche. The good ones are:
- Expensive ($150-250/hour, which is $300K-500K per year per person)
- In high demand (booked 3-6 months out)
- Prefer longer engagements (6+ months minimum)
- Need to understand manufacturing (can't just bring in any contractor)

**Where to find them:**
- Specialized recruiting firms (TEKsystems, Insight Global - they have manufacturing practices)
- Industry associations (ISA - International Society of Automation)
- Networking through manufacturing IT groups
- Former employees who went independent

**Lead time: 2-3 months** to find and onboard contractors with manufacturing experience. And that's if we start now.

Tom needs those contractors in place BEFORE migration starts, which means starting recruiting immediately if we're serious about this.

**Interviewer**: Let's talk about retention. Alex mentioned 5 people at flight risk - Kevin, Rachel, and three others. Tom's already lost 3 people. How do we address this?

**Linda**: Retention in a major change initiative is critical. Let me give you a comprehensive strategy.

**Retention Strategy - Multi-Layered Approach:**

**Layer 1: Financial Incentives**

Retention bonuses for key people:
- **Tier 1** (Critical - Kevin, Tom, key leads): $15-20K per person
- **Tier 2** (Important - Rachel, senior staff): $10-12K per person  
- **Tier 3** (Solid contributors): $5-8K per person

Structure: 50% at 12 months, 50% at 24 months (or project completion)

**Who qualifies:**
- Kevin (infrastructure lead) - Tier 1
- Tom (support lead) - Tier 1
- Rachel (senior developer) - Tier 2
- Steve (only support person with manufacturing background) - Tier 2
- Other at-risk staff - Tier 2 or 3

**Cost estimate:**
- 5-7 Tier 1 people: $75-140K
- 8-10 Tier 2 people: $80-120K
- 10-15 Tier 3 people: $50-120K
- **Total retention bonuses: $205-380K** (let's budget $400K to be safe)

**Layer 2: Career Development**

People leave when they don't see growth opportunity. This migration is actually an opportunity:
- Azure/cloud skills development (marketable skills)
- Architecture exposure (senior staff work with architects)
- Leadership opportunities (people can grow into lead roles)
- Certifications (pay for Azure certifications - $2-3K per person)

Message this as: "You'll leave this project more valuable in the job market, with skills companies want."

**Cost: $50-75K for certifications and training materials**

**Layer 3: Work-Life Balance**

This is huge. Tom's team is getting 3-4 pages per night. Alex's team is at 80-90%+ capacity. People are tired.

**Actions:**
- No expectation of 60-hour weeks for 3 years
- Reasonable timeline (36-48 months, not 18 months)
- Contractors to share load (don't depend only on internal team)
- Time off between major milestones (recharge periods)
- Flexible work arrangements where possible

This doesn't cost money (except contractors), but it costs willpower - leadership has to enforce reasonable working hours.

**Layer 4: Recognition and Involvement**

People want to feel valued. Actions:
- Involve team in planning (not just informed after decisions)
- Regular recognition of contributions
- Town halls where team explains work to company
- Executive visibility (Michael thanking team directly)

**Cost: Mostly time and attention, minimal budget**

**Layer 5: Psychological Safety**

After SAP trauma, people need to know:
- Mistakes will happen - that's okay
- No one will be scapegoated
- Leadership has their backs
- They can speak up about problems

This requires cultural shift from top down.

**Total Retention Investment: $450-475K** (bonuses + certifications + some padding)

I originally estimated $500K - that's still about right, maybe a bit light.

**Interviewer**: What's the cost of NOT retaining these people? What if Kevin or Tom leaves?

**Linda**: Oh, that's catastrophic. Let me quantify it.

**If Kevin Leaves** (Infrastructure Lead, 11 years):

**Immediate costs:**
- Recruiting fee: $15-20K (20-25% of salary)
- Vacancy cost: 3-6 months @ $75K salary = $18-37K
- Overtime for others covering his work: $10-20K

**Knowledge loss:**
- Kevin knows every system, every quirk, every workaround
- Institutional knowledge: 11 years, can't be replaced quickly
- Relationships: Trust with vendors, floor workers, other staff
- Time for replacement to reach Kevin's knowledge level: 2-3 years

**Project impact:**
- Migration timeline extends 3-6 months (new person learning curve)
- Higher risk of mistakes (new person doesn't know systems)
- Morale impact (if Kevin leaves, others think "maybe I should too")

**Total cost if Kevin leaves: $50-75K direct, $200-500K indirect (timeline delay, knowledge loss, risk)**

**If Tom Leaves** (Support Lead, 6 years):

Similar impact, maybe worse:
- Support team already demoralized - Tom leaving would devastate them
- Likely triggers more departures (domino effect)
- Support is critical during migration - losing Tom is disaster

**Total cost if Tom leaves: $75-100K direct, $500K-1M indirect**

**If Rachel Leaves** (Senior Developer, 8 years):

Less catastrophic than Kevin or Tom, but still bad:
- MES custom components need development - Rachel is key
- Development team already thin
- $30-50K direct, $100-200K indirect

**Bottom line: Spending $400-500K on retention saves $1-3M in costs if key people leave.**

It's a no-brainer investment.

**Interviewer**: Let's talk about training. You estimated $12-15M in our first interview. With the expanded scope and timeline, does that change?

**Linda**: Let me recalculate with what we know now.

**Updated Training Cost Estimate:**

**IT Team Training** (30 people, 12 months):
- Azure/cloud training: $3,000-5,000 per person
- Hands-on practice environment: $10-20K/month for 12 months
- Certifications: $2-3K per person
- External trainers/consultants: $150-200/hour for workshops
- **Subtotal: $1.2-1.8M**

**Support Team Training** (10 existing + 4-6 new = 14-16 people, 3-6 months):
- Azure fundamentals: $2,000-3,000 per person
- Manufacturing systems training: $1,500-2,500 per person
- Hands-on practice: $5-10K/month for 6 months
- **Subtotal: $80-130K**

**Floor Supervisors** (3 people, 40-50 hours each):
- Training delivery: $150/hour instructor rate
- Materials and practice environments
- **Subtotal: $25-35K** (no change from original estimate)

**Floor Operators** (50 people, 80-100 hours each):
This is the big one. With 36-48 month timeline, we can actually do this properly:
- Training delivery: $150/hour × 4,000-5,000 hours
- Materials, practice environments
- Manufacturing-experienced trainers (premium rate)
- Phased delivery over 12-18 months (can't train 50 people at once)
- **Subtotal: $11-14M** (consistent with original estimate)

**Change Management Team Training:**
- Change management professionals need training on our systems
- Manufacturing context education
- **Subtotal: $25-50K**

**Revised Total: $12.5-16M**

So actually a bit higher than my original $12-15M, but in the same ballpark. The longer timeline (36-48 months) actually helps because we can phase training delivery better.

**Interviewer**: Where do we find manufacturing-experienced trainers for operators?

**Linda**: This is specialized. Options:

**Option 1: Manufacturing Training Firms**
- Companies that specialize in manufacturing training
- Examples: ToolingU, MasterControl, industry-specific firms
- They understand manufacturing context
- **Cost: Premium rates ($150-250/hour)**
- **Availability: 3-6 month lead time**

**Option 2: Retired Manufacturing Professionals**
- Former supervisors, former engineers who know manufacturing
- Train them on new systems, they train operators
- They speak operators' language
- **Cost: Moderate ($75-150/hour)**
- **Availability: Need to recruit through networks**

**Option 3: Hybrid - Software Vendor + Manufacturing SME**
- Software vendor provides technical training
- Manufacturing subject matter expert provides context and translation
- Team teaching approach
- **Cost: Combined rates ($200-300/hour for both)**

**My recommendation: Option 3** - hybrid approach. Get technical trainers from software vendors, pair them with manufacturing experts who can translate and provide context.

**Lead time: 4-6 months** to identify and onboard trainers. This should start in planning phase, not when we're ready to train.

**Interviewer**: Let's talk about change management. You said you need a proper change management team. What does that look like?

**Linda**: Change management for a 36-48 month initiative is not a part-time job. Here's what we need:

**Change Management Team Composition:**

**Change Manager** (1 FTE, full project duration):
- Professional change practitioner (Prosci certified ideally)
- Develops change strategy
- Manages stakeholder engagement
- Coordinates communications
- Monitors adoption and addresses resistance
- **Cost: $120-150K/year × 3-4 years = $360-600K**

**Communications Specialist** (1 FTE, full project):
- Develops communication materials
- Manages town halls, newsletters, updates
- Crafts messaging for different audiences
- **Cost: $70-90K/year × 3-4 years = $210-360K**

**Training Coordinator** (1 FTE, ramps up in year 2-3):
- Coordinates all training logistics
- Schedules training sessions
- Tracks completion and effectiveness
- Manages training vendors
- **Cost: $60-80K/year × 2-3 years = $120-240K**

**Change Champions Network** (10-15 people, part-time):
- Representatives from each department
- Meet monthly, act as change advocates
- Gather feedback from their teams
- Help with local change efforts
- **Cost: Mostly time, maybe $25-50K for workshops and materials**

**Executive Sponsor** (Michael, part-time):
- Visible leadership commitment
- Decision-making authority
- **Cost: Time allocation, no additional budget**

**Total Change Management Budget: $750K-1.25M over 3-4 years**

Can we do it cheaper? Sure. Can we do it well cheaper? No.

SAP failed partly because change management was inadequate. Don't repeat that mistake.

**Interviewer**: You mentioned union implications in our first interview. How do we approach the union on this?

**Linda**: Very carefully. The operators are unionized - UAW Local 428. The union's job is to protect workers' interests, and a major technology change affects workers.

**Union Partnership Strategy:**

**Phase 1: Early Engagement** (Before any formal announcements):
- Meet with union leadership (Local president, shop steward)
- Explain what we're considering and why
- Ask for their input and concerns
- Make it clear: we're not trying to eliminate jobs or make their members' jobs harder

**Phase 2: Collaborative Planning**:
- Include union representative in planning discussions
- Address concerns proactively (job security, adequate training, support)
- Negotiate any contractual implications (work rules, training time, etc.)
- Document agreements in MOU (memorandum of understanding)

**Phase 3: Member Communication**:
- Union helps communicate to members
- Joint town halls (management + union)
- Transparent about timeline, training, support
- Regular updates through union channels

**Key Union Concerns to Address:**

**Job Security:**
- Clear statement: No job losses due to technology change
- New systems should make jobs easier, not eliminate jobs
- If workload changes, retrain/reassign, don't lay off

**Training:**
- Adequate time for training (80-100 hours per operator)
- Training on company time (paid time, not personal time)
- Practice environments before going live
- No penalties for learning curve

**Support:**
- 24/7 support during transition
- Floor-level help, not just help desk
- No blame for system issues

**Work Rules:**
- Will new systems change how operators do their jobs?
- Do union contracts need to be updated?
- Negotiate changes collaboratively

**Timeline:**
- Union will want gradual rollout, not force-switch
- Parallel running period (old system available during learning)
- Ability to provide feedback and raise concerns

**What Not to Do:**
- ❌ Announce project without talking to union first
- ❌ Frame it as "you'll adapt or else"
- ❌ Cut corners on training to save money
- ❌ Blame operators if adoption is slow

**What To Do:**
- ✅ Partnership approach (not adversarial)
- ✅ Early and ongoing communication
- ✅ Address concerns proactively
- ✅ Make operators' jobs easier (prove it)
- ✅ Respect collective bargaining process

**Union Timeline: 3-6 months** for initial engagement and MOU negotiation. This should happen in planning phase, before any floor worker training starts.

**Interviewer**: What are the biggest HR risks for this project?

**Linda**: Let me give you my top 5:

**Risk 1: Attrition Spiral**

If one key person leaves (Kevin, Tom, Steve), others think "time to go" and you get cascade of departures. This is especially risky with:
- Support team (already demoralized)
- IT team (25% at flight risk per Alex)
- Floor operators (if they hate new systems)

**Mitigation: Robust retention strategy, address concerns early, realistic timeline**

**Risk 2: Burnout Epidemic**

If we try to do this in 18 months with inadequate resources, people burn out. Then they either leave or they stay but become unproductive and resentful.

**Mitigation: 36-48 month timeline, adequate contractors, work-life balance**

**Risk 3: Skills Gap Not Addressed**

If we don't properly upskill teams before migration, they'll be incompetent executing migration. Mistakes will be made, costs will escalate, timeline will slip, morale will tank.

**Mitigation: 12-month training phase before migration, external expertise**

**Risk 4: Union Resistance**

If we handle union poorly, they can make adoption very difficult. Not through formal grievances (though that's possible) but through passive resistance - slow adoption, finding every problem, spreading negativity.

**Mitigation: Partnership approach, early engagement, address concerns**

**Risk 5: SAP Trauma Repeats**

If this feels like SAP 2.0 - rushed, inadequate training, poor support, imposed from top down - people will resist actively. The psychological damage from SAP is real and deep.

**Mitigation: Explicitly acknowledge SAP failures, demonstrate this is different, involve people from start**

**Interviewer**: If you were advising Michael on the people aspects, what would you tell him?

**Linda**: Four things:

**First: This is a people project that happens to involve technology.**

The technical work is complex but doable. The people work - building trust, managing change, retaining talent, upskilling teams - that's what determines success or failure.

Don't think "we'll figure out the people stuff later." People aspects need to be planned and resourced from day one.

**Second: Budget properly for people investments.**

The people costs are substantial:
- Training: $12.5-16M
- Contractors: $5-7M  
- Retention: $400-500K
- Change management: $750K-1.25M
- Support staff hiring: $60-110K recruiting fees + $300-450K annual salaries

That's roughly $19-25M just for people aspects. That's probably 60-70% of the total project budget.

Don't cut these to hit a budget number. They're not optional - they're what makes the technical work successful.

**Third: Time is your friend, not your enemy.**

18 months forces shortcuts, burns people out, causes mistakes. 36-48 months allows:
- Proper preparation (training, architecture, planning)
- Phased execution (learn from each step)
- People recovery time (recharge between major milestones)
- Building trust (demonstrate competence before asking for big leaps)

Yes, it costs more to spread over 4 years. But it costs WAY more to fail in 18 months and have to redo it.

**Fourth: Trust your people advisors.**

You hired Sarah, Tom, Alex, me, David, Jennifer - we all have experience and expertise. When we say something won't work, we're not being negative or resistant. We're being realistic based on our experience.

Listen to us. Trust us. We want this to succeed - but only if we do it right.

**Interviewer**: Last question: What does success look like from HR perspective?

**Linda**: Three years from now:

**People Success Indicators:**

- **Retention:** Kevin, Tom, Rachel, Steve, and other key people are still here and engaged
- **Skills:** Team has modern cloud skills, more valuable in job market, proud of what they've learned
- **Morale:** People feel challenged but not burned out, excited about what we've accomplished
- **Culture:** Trust rebuilt between IT and floor, partnership model working
- **Operators:** Floor workers using new systems confidently, jobs easier not harder
- **Reputation:** We're known as a company that does major change well, that values its people

**Organizational Outcomes:**

- Zero attrition directly attributable to migration stress
- Union partnership strong (they'd say "management did it right")
- New systems adopted enthusiastically (not reluctantly)
- Company culture stronger (survived big challenge together)
- Recruiting easier (word gets out we're a good place to work)

That's what success looks like from where I sit.

**Interviewer**: Thank you, Linda. This has been incredibly valuable.

**Linda**: You're welcome. I really hope Michael takes all of this seriously. We can do this - but only if we commit to doing it right. And "right" means investing in people, taking the time to do it properly, and building partnership rather than mandating change.

Good luck with the synthesis. I think you have all the information you need now.
