# Interview 6: Jimmy Garcia - Union Steward (UAW Local 599)

**Date**: Friday, November 8, 2024  
**Duration**: 73 minutes  
**Interviewer**: Discovery Facilitator  
**Interviewee**: Jimmy Garcia, Union Steward, UAW Local 599  
**Location**: Union hall, 3:00 PM (after factory shift)

---

## Executive Summary

Jimmy Garcia revealed critical union considerations that create both constraints and opportunities for the Azure migration. His assessment: 5/10 confidence currently, could move to 8-9/10 with proper engagement. The union is NOT anti-technology, but requires protection of members' jobs and livelihoods.

**Key Findings**:
- **Union contract requires 120-day notice** before major tech changes (Article 12)
- **Contract renewal in 18 months** (July 2026) - timing is important
- **No layoffs commitment is THE non-negotiable** - everything else is negotiable
- **2019 contract negotiation created trust deficit** (lost wage fight, 1.5% vs 3% desired)
- **2018 SAP trauma still remembered** - broken promises, inadequate training, 6-month nightmare
- **Strike authorization likely if jobs threatened** (87% yes vote in 2019, would expect 80-90% for egregious violations)
- **Early involvement = partnership; late involvement = adversarial fight**
- **Union wants company to succeed** (company failure = job loss anyway)

**Critical Opportunity**: Jimmy is open to partnership if Michael engages now (Phase 0), commits to no layoffs, provides real training, and gives union seat at table.

**Critical Risk**: If union not engaged properly, strike authorization becomes likely. Cost: $240K/day production loss.

## Part 1: First Reaction - Pattern Recognition

### Initial Response to "Cloud Migration"

**Jimmy's First Thought**: "How many jobs?"

**Pattern Recognition**:
- Technology changes usually mean job elimination
- Always pitched as "efficiency" or "optimization" or "doing more with less"
- Reality for workers: Pink slips, forced retirement, or "Learn new system or leave"

### Historical Example: 2019 QA Camera Automation

**Management's Pitch**: "Helping the quality team" with automated inspection cameras  
**Reality**: Plan to eliminate 2 QA positions ($60K salaries each = $120K savings)  
**Union Response**: Pushed back successfully  
**Outcome**: Kept the 2 jobs, added cameras as tools (not replacements)

**Two positions saved**:
- Tony: 15 years tenure, knows every MES quirk, trained half the floor
- Maria: Eye for defects better than any camera

### Five Whys: Why Push Back on Cameras?

1. **Why push back?** → Two good jobs at risk ($26/hour, benefits, seniority)
2. **Why eliminate positions?** → Cost savings (CFO sees $120K on spreadsheet)
3. **Why is human element important?** → Institutional knowledge, defect detection before gauges show problems, training capability
4. **Why doesn't management see that?** → Under pressure (board wants profits, stockholders want growth, customers want lower prices)
5. **Why is labor always first place they look?** → Biggest line item, and "we can't leave" - equipment doesn't complain, buildings don't strike, but people organize

**Root Cause**: Labor is always in crosshairs because workers can organize and push back, making them a "problem" to solve rather than an asset to invest in.

---

## Part 2: The 2019 Contract Negotiation

### What Happened

**Timeline**: 6 months of negotiation  
**Issue**: Wages and benefits

**Company Position**:
- 3-year wage freeze
- "Can't afford raises"
- Posted $12M profit that year but claimed profit ≠ cash flow

**Union Position**:
- Requested 3% annual raises
- "Profit means you CAN afford it"
- "Our families need to eat and pay rent"

**Outcome**:
- Strike authorization vote: 87% YES
- Final compromise: 1.5% annual raises for 3 years
- Felt like a loss (cost of living > 1.5%, effective pay cut)

### Impact on Relationship

**Immediate** (Year following):
- Trust at low point
- Workers felt undervalued
- Morale "in the toilet"
- Turnover increased (lost good people to better-paying plants)
- Robert tried to bridge gap, but tension remained

**Long-term**:
- Created skepticism toward management promises
- Established pattern: Management doesn't value workers as assets

### Jobs-to-be-Done: What Union Wanted

**Surface Level**: More money (3% vs 1.5%)

**Deeper Level**: Recognition and respect
- "Acknowledge our people are why you're profitable"
- "Say 'Yes, you're valuable. Yes, we'll invest in you.'"
- Company's message received: "You're a cost to be managed, not an asset to invest in"

### Rebuilding Trust

**Jimmy's Requirements**:
1. **Actions, not words** - Show you value workforce
2. **Invest in training, not layoffs**
3. **Talk early, not after decisions made**
4. **Treat as partners, not obstacles**

**This Interview as Signal**: "You're asking questions, not telling us how it's gonna be. That's rare."

## Part 3: The Union Contract - Key Provisions

### Contract Status
- **Current contract**: Active
- **Renewal date**: July 2026 (18 months from now)
- **Relevance**: Technology changes during contract term must comply with current contract

### Article 7: Job Security

**Protection Against Layoffs**:
- No layoffs without cause (performance, misconduct, business closure)
- Technology/process changes do NOT count as "cause"

**If Positions Eliminated Due to Technology**:
- 90 days notice minimum
- First right to any open positions (with training if needed)
- Severance: 2 weeks pay per year of service (capped at 52 weeks)
- Extended health benefits for 6 months

**Example**: Worker with 12 years service laid off due to automation = 24 weeks severance + 6 months health benefits

### Article 12: Technological Change (CRITICAL)

**120-Day Notice Requirement**:
- Management MUST notify union 120 days before implementing major tech changes
- "Major tech changes" = Systems used by union members, process changes affecting roles

**Union Rights During 120-Day Period**:
- Review impacts on workforce:
  - Jobs affected
  - Skills needed
  - Training required
- Good-faith negotiation on:
  - Training programs for affected workers
  - Transition timeline
  - Redeployment opportunities
  - Compensation for workers needing retraining

**Implication for Azure Migration**:
- 120-day notice required before MES, ERP, or other floor-facing system changes
- Union gets to review and negotiate training/redeployment
- Cannot be short-cut ("This is IT infrastructure, doesn't affect you" won't fly)

### Article 15: Seniority

**All Job Assignments Based on Seniority**:
- Layoffs: Most junior goes first
- Recalls: Most senior comes back first
- New roles: Senior workers get first opportunity

**Technology Change Implications**:
- If Azure creates "cloud engineer" or "data analyst" roles, must offer to existing workers first (with training)
- Cannot lay off 12-year worker and hire fresh college grad for new role
- Violates contract spirit even if technically following letter

**Jimmy's Stance**: 
> "You can't lay off a guy with 12 years seniority and then turn around and hire a college kid fresh out of school for a 'cloud engineer' role."

### Training Requirement

**If Skills Gap Exists**:
- Company must provide REAL training (not token training to check a box)
- "Months-long programs with dedicated instructors, hands-on practice, and support"
- Pay workers regular wage while training (not volunteer time)
- Give workers fair shot to learn

**Only AFTER Real Training**:
- If workers truly can't perform new roles after genuine opportunity
- Then can discuss external hiring
- But cannot skip the training step

---

## Part 4: Automation and Job Loss Fears

### Pattern: Technology Usually Eliminates Jobs

**Jimmy's Experience**: "Almost always. Not immediately, not all at once, but yeah."

**How It's Framed**:
- "Efficiency gains"
- "Doing more with less"
- "Staying competitive"

**What Actually Happens**:
- Savings from eliminated jobs → Executive bonuses + shareholder dividends
- NOT → Investment in remaining workers or hiring for NEW things

### Counterexample: 2015 Medical Device Product Line

**What Happened**: Added new product line requiring:
- Clean room environment
- More sophisticated quality controls
- Tighter tolerances
- Advanced technology

**Result**: Hired 30 people ($28-32/hour for specialized skills)

**Why It Worked**: GROWTH strategy, not replacement strategy
- Doing something NEW that required both technology AND people
- Not automating existing jobs

### Five Whys: Job Elimination vs Job Creation

1. **What's the difference?** → Business strategy: Cost-cutting vs growth
2. **Why focus on cost-cutting?** → Easy and immediate vs hard and risky
3. **Why is growth hard?** → Takes years, investment, risk; cost-cutting shows on next quarter P&L
4. **Why do boards want results now?** → Short-term thinking, stock price today > sustainable 20-year business
5. **Why short-term thinking?** → "I don't know, I'm not a board member. But from where I sit, it looks like short-term thinking."

**Root Cause**: Cost-cutting is fast path to quarterly results; growth requires long-term investment and patience boards don't have.

### What Workers Need from Azure Migration

**Jimmy's List**:
1. **Promise this isn't about cutting jobs** - In writing, backed by actions
2. **Training opportunities if roles change** - Real training, not token
3. **Honesty** - Don't say "investing in people" if planning to cut headcount
4. **Time** - Can't retrain 50-year-old lathe operator to cloud engineer overnight

---

## Part 5: MES System and Factory Floor Impact

### MES System Importance

**What It Is**: Manufacturing Execution System - tracks everything on factory floor
- Work orders
- Materials
- Quality checks
- Equipment status
- Production counts

**Usage**: Every operator uses it multiple times per shift  
**Users**: All 180 UAW members

### Jimmy's Immediate Concerns About MES Cloud Migration

**1. Interface Changes?**
- 180 operators know current MES cold (some using it 10 years)
- Any changes slow production during relearning period
- Major concern if interface redesigned

**2. What If It Breaks?**
- Current: Kevin's team fixes in ~30 minutes (servers on-site)
- Cloud: Who fixes it? How long? Microsoft? Contractor?
- Do they understand our operation?
- Downtime impact: $10K/minute = $600K/hour

**3. Internet Dependency?**
- Currently: MES is local, keeps working if internet down
- Cloud: Does MES stop if Comcast has issues?
- Storms, outages happen - what's the impact?

**4. Data Security?**
- Make components for medical devices and defense contractors
- Regulations about data security
- Is cloud secure? Can adversaries (China, Russia) hack production data?
- Compliance risk if security inadequate

**5. Training?**
- Even if interface same, some differences will exist
- Who trains operators? When?
- Do operators get paid for training time?
- How much time allocated per operator?

### The Core Issue

**Jimmy's Point**: 
> "If you involve us early, we can ask these questions BEFORE you spend millions of dollars on a solution that doesn't work for the floor."

**Current State**: First time hearing about Azure migration (this interview)  
**Ideal State**: Involved from day one to raise concerns during planning, not after

---

## Part 6: Trust and Past Broken Promises

### The 2018 SAP Disaster

**Management's Promise**:
- "Make your jobs easier"
- "Streamline processes"
- "Reduce paperwork"
- "Give you better tools"

**Reality**:
- 6-month nightmare
- System so buggy operators couldn't get materials approved
- Orders got lost
- Production delays
- Lost 3 weeks of production

**Root Causes**:
- No union input before implementation
- Inadequate testing
- Insufficient training (2-hour overview, then "figure it out")

**Union Experience**:
- Members stressed (system broken, still have quotas)
- Working overtime to work around bugs
- Management response: "We've spent $2M, we're committed, just deal with it"
- Concerns raised in labor-management meetings, dismissed
- Problems blamed on "user error" or "resistance to change"
- Unplanned overtime, grievances filed for proper OT pay (took months to resolve)

**Impact on Trust**: Severely damaged - pattern of not listening to floor, dismissing concerns, defensive rather than collaborative

### Jobs-to-be-Done: What Union Needed During SAP

**1. Honesty**: "Hey, we screwed up, this rollout is a mess, we're sorry" (got defensive corporatespeak instead)

**2. Listen to Floor**: Operators knew biggest problems within 48 hours (management dismissed as "user error" instead of prioritizing fixes)

**3. Compensation**: Proper OT pay for unplanned overtime dealing with SAP issues (had to file grievances, took months)

### Earning Union Support for MES Cloud Migration

**Jimmy's Six Requirements**:

**1. Involve Us from Day One**
- Not after plan is made - FROM DAY ONE
- Let union ask questions, raise concerns, contribute ideas

**2. Pilot It First**
- Don't roll out to whole factory day one
- Pilot with one production line
- Work out bugs
- Let volunteer operators give feedback
- THEN expand

**3. Real Training**
- Not 2-hour overview
- Real, hands-on training with time to practice
- Paid training time (not "learn on your lunch break")

**4. Parallel Running with Rollback**
- Robert mentioned 3 months; Jimmy prefers 6 months
- Keep old system available
- If new system fails, fall back immediately
- Cannot have production down for days

**5. Support**
- Fast support when issues arise
- Kevin's team on-site OR someone on-call 24/5 who knows operation
- Not generic Microsoft support ticket (48-hour response time)

**6. No Layoffs Tied to This**
- Crystal clear commitment
- In writing
- Not backdoor way to eliminate jobs

---

## Part 7: The Layoff Question (Direct)

### What Jimmy Wants to Know

**The Question**: "If this Azure migration moves forward, will people lose their jobs?"

**What Jimmy Wants**: Honest answer from Michael, not corporate double-talk

### What "Honest" Sounds Like

**Good Answer** (Jimmy's words):
> "Look, we're moving infrastructure to the cloud. That MIGHT mean we need different skills - less 'keep servers running' work, more 'manage cloud services' work. We'll retrain our current IT staff for those roles. Some positions might change, but nobody's getting laid off. If someone can't or doesn't want to retrain, we'll find them another role in the company based on their seniority."

**Bad Answer**:
> "Oh no, this is about efficiency and innovation, don't worry."
> (Because that's what they always say, then 6 months later comes "restructuring")

### If Michael Genuinely Doesn't Know Yet

**Acceptable Response**:
> "I don't know yet. We're doing discovery. When we know, you'll know. And before we make any decisions that affect jobs, we'll talk to the union."

**Why This Works**: It's honest. Jimmy can work with honest.

### Five Whys: Why Late Involvement Makes Things Ugly

1. **Why does late involvement make things ugly?** → Union negotiates from position of weakness
2. **Why is that weakness?** → Plan already made, money spent, vendors committed - won't undo it
3. **Why won't they undo it?** → Sunk cost, momentum, executive reputations tied to plan
4. **What's the result?** → Union left with damage control (negotiate severance, save some jobs, file grievances) instead of shaping solution
5. **Why is that adversarial?** → Union reacting to THEIR plan, not creating something together

**Root Cause**: Late involvement = damage control (adversarial); early involvement = solution creation (collaborative)

### Why Management Involves Unions Late

**Jimmy's Theory**: "Because they see us as an obstacle, not a partner."
- Think early involvement = union says "no" to everything and slows things down
- Try to present done deal and hope union accepts

**The Irony**: 
> "When we say 'no' late, it's WAY more disruptive than if we raised concerns early. Early, it's a conversation. Late, it's a fight."

### Changing Management Perception

**What Would Help**: Positive experiences
- Involve union early on something
- Work together
- It goes well
- Builds trust for next time

**Robert as Example**: 
- Asks for union input on operational stuff all the time
- Union has given him good ideas
- He's not afraid of union

**Other Executives**: 
- Finance and IT only interact with union during contract negotiations or problems
- Only see union as adversaries
- Don't know union can be partners

---

## Part 8: What the Union Needs (Non-Negotiables)

### Jimmy's Seven Non-Negotiables

**1. No Layoffs Commitment** (THE BIG ONE)
- Written guarantee
- No involuntary layoffs from this migration
- If positions change, affected workers get retrained or redeployed based on seniority
- Period.

**2. 120-Day Notice (Per Contract)**
- Article 12 requires this
- Don't try to short-cut
- Union needs time to prepare, ask questions, represent members

**3. Meaningful Training Program**
- REAL training (not token training to check box)
- Months-long programs with dedicated instructors
- Hands-on practice and support
- Pay regular wage during training (not volunteer time)

**4. Parallel Running with Rollback**
- Don't cut over all at once
- Run old and new systems in parallel AT LEAST 3 months (Jimmy prefers 6)
- Clear rollback plan if things go wrong
- Cannot risk extended production downtime

**5. Floor Input on User Interfaces**
- If systems operators use daily (MES, etc.) are changing
- Let actual operators test and provide feedback BEFORE finalizing designs
- They know what works and what doesn't

**6. 24/5 Support**
- Production runs Monday-Friday, 24 hours
- If cloud system down at 2 AM Wednesday, need FAST fix
- Not ticket answered Monday morning
- Define support model before agreeing to anything

**7. Contract Compliance**
- All seniority, job posting, redeployment rules still apply
- Can't bypass contract because "technology modernization"

### Which is Most Important?

**Jimmy's Answer**: 
> "The first one - no layoffs - that's the big one. If you commit to that in writing and back it up with actions, we can be flexible on some other stuff. But if you're planning layoffs, we're going to fight this from day one."

### "Backing It Up with Actions"

What that means:
- Show us the retraining plan
- Show us the budget for training
- Introduce us to the people who'll do the training
- Let us talk to workers being retrained
- Give us visibility this isn't empty words

---

## Part 9: Strike Authorization - The Nuclear Option

### Context: 2019 Strike Authorization

**Scenario**: Contract negotiation (wage dispute)  
**Vote**: 87% YES on strike authorization  
**Result**: Gave union leverage, got 1.5% raises (vs 0% company offered)  
**Lesson**: Strike authorization is powerful negotiating tool

### Scenarios Where Union Would Authorize Strike

**Scenario 1: Surprise Layoffs**
- Michael proceeds with migration
- 6 months in: "Oh, by the way, we're eliminating 20 positions"
- No warning, no input
- **Union Response**: Strike authorization vote (likely 80-90% yes)
- **Reason**: Violation of trust and contract

**Scenario 2: Unsafe Rollout**
- Cut over critical systems without proper testing, parallel running, or rollback
- Creates safety risks or extended downtime
- **Union Response**: Shut it down, potentially strike
- **Reason**: Safety is non-negotiable

**Scenario 3: Contract Violations**
- Bypass seniority rules
- Don't provide required 120-day notice
- Violate contract because "this is different, this is technology"
- **Union Response**: File grievances, potentially authorize strike
- **Reason**: Contract must be honored

**Scenario 4: Refusal to Negotiate**
- Management says "We're doing this, union has no input, deal with it"
- **Union Response**: Bad faith, push back hard, potentially strike authorization
- **Reason**: Union has legal right to negotiate technological changes

### Strike Authorization Process

**Step 1: Authorize Strike Vote**
- Gives bargaining committee permission to call strike if needed
- This authorization itself is leverage in negotiations
- Says "We're serious, you need to address our concerns"

**Step 2: Set Strike Date (If Negotiations Fail)**
- Give 10 days notice (required by law for manufacturing)
- Gives management last chance to come to table

**Step 3: Strike (If Still No Resolution)**
- Picket lines go up
- Production stops
- **Cost**: $240K/day (per Robert)
- 1-week strike = $1.68M lost production

### Strike Authorization as Negotiating Tool

**Jimmy's Explanation**:
> "It's a signal. It says 'This matters enough that we're willing to walk out if you don't take us seriously.' Most of the time, that's enough to get management's attention and get real negotiations going."

**But Not a Bluff**:
> "If we authorize it and things don't improve, we WILL strike. It's not a bluff."

## Part 10: What Success Looks Like

### For the Workers

- Nobody loses their job
- People get trained for new skills that make them MORE valuable
- Work gets easier, not harder (better tools, less firefighting)
- Job security improves (company more competitive)
- Maybe new jobs created (can do new things with better technology)

### For the Union

- Involved from start as partner, not afterthought
- Management listened to concerns and addressed them
- Proved early union involvement makes projects go BETTER
- Built trust with Michael and IT leadership for future initiatives
- Set precedent: This is how technology changes should work

### For the Company

- Migration succeeds with minimal disruption
- No work stoppages or labor issues
- Operators adopt new systems quickly (had input and training)
- Production actually IMPROVES (systems more reliable)
- Company becomes more competitive (good for everyone's job security)

### Six Requirements for Success

**One**: Michael meets with Jimmy + bargaining committee in next 30 days
- Not courtesy meeting ("Hey, we're doing this")
- Real meeting ("Tell us your concerns, let's figure this out together")

**Two**: Transparency on plan
- What systems moving?
- What's the timeline?
- What are the risks?
- What jobs might be affected?
- Real story, not sanitized PR version

**Three**: Written commitment to no layoffs
- From Michael, endorsed by CEO
- Leadership is committed

**Four**: Joint planning
- Union gets seat at table for decisions affecting floor
- Not veto power, but genuine input

**Five**: Pilot approach
- Test, learn, adjust, THEN roll out broadly
- Don't bet company on untested approach

**Six**: Ongoing communication
- Not just kickoff meeting then radio silence
- Regular updates
- Open door to raise issues
- Responsive to concerns

**Jimmy's Assessment**:
> "Do those six things, and yeah, I think this could be a success story. Skip them, and it's going to be a fight."

---

## Part 11: Jimmy's Advice to Michael

### If Michael Asked Directly

**Jimmy's Message** (his words):

> "Michael, I know you're new here - 60 days in, right? So let me give you the union's perspective.
>
> We're not here to block progress. We're not anti-technology or anti-change. We're here to protect our members' jobs and livelihoods. That's our job, just like your job is to modernize IT.
>
> Most technology projects fail not because of the technology, but because of the people side. You ignore the people who use the systems every day, you get resistance. You surprise people with job changes, you get resistance. You treat us like an obstacle, we become an obstacle.
>
> But if you involve us early, if you listen to concerns, if you work WITH us instead of around us, we can be your biggest allies. We want this place to succeed - our members' jobs depend on it. We have insights you don't have because we're on the floor every day. Use that.
>
> The 180 workers I represent? They're not opposed to Azure or the cloud or whatever. They're worried about their paychecks, their families, their futures. Address those worries honestly, and they'll support you. Ignore those worries, and you'll have problems.
>
> This conversation right here - you asking questions in Phase 0 before decisions are made? This is exactly the right approach. Keep doing that. Meet with me and the committee. Be transparent. Commit to no layoffs. Give us a seat at the table.
>
> Do that, and I'll be your advocate, not your adversary. I'll help you make this work. But try to ram this through without us, and you'll understand why we're called organized labor."

**Would Jimmy Say This to Michael's Face?**: Yes, he would. And he hopes Michael listens.

## Part 12: The Union's Decision Framework

### Three Questions That Determine Union Position

**Question 1: Do We Trust Michael and Leadership?**

Not just about promises - about whether they'll follow through:
- Have they been straight with us so far?
- Have they involved us genuinely or just checked a box?
- Do they understand and respect our concerns?

**If YES** → Inclined to support  
**If NO** → Opposed

**Question 2: Are Our Members' Jobs Protected?**

Not just "no layoffs" in writing - are there REAL plans:
- Concrete retraining plans?
- Budget allocated?
- New roles being created?
- Seniority being respected?

**If YES** → Can support  
**If NO** → Oppose

**Question 3: Will This Actually Make Company More Successful?**

Union wants company to succeed (failure = job loss anyway):
- Is this well-planned?
- Have experts reviewed it?
- Are there phase gates and go/no-go decisions?
- Realistic budget and timeline?

**If YES** → Support  
**If NO** → Oppose (bad for everyone)

### Not Just "Protect Jobs at All Costs"

**Jimmy's Clarification**:
> "We're not stupid. If the company fails, our members lose jobs anyway. We want the company to succeed. But we want success that INCLUDES our members, not at their expense."

**The Sweet Spot**:
> "If Michael can show us a plan where the company succeeds AND workers are protected, we'll support it enthusiastically."

### If Union Decides to Oppose

**Escalation Path**:
1. **Communication**: Explain to members why opposed, what concerns are
2. **Formal Objections**: File with management
3. **Contract Provisions**: Invoke Article 12 (technological change)
4. **Grievances**: If contract violated
5. **Work-to-Rule**: Follow every rule to letter (slows things down)
6. **Public Pressure**: If needed
7. **Strike Authorization**: Ultimate tool

**Last Resort**:
> "I'd much rather be at the table working on solutions than outside throwing rocks."

---

## Confidence Assessment

**Facilitator**: On scale of 1-10, how confident are you this Azure migration can succeed with union support?

**Jimmy**: "Right now? Based on what I know? I'd say a 5 out of 10."

### Why 5?

**Positive Signals** (why not 2-3):
- Robert involved early (good sign)
- Discovery phase happening (not rushing)
- Getting asked questions before decisions made
- This interview happening at all

**Uncertainty** (why not 8-9):
- Haven't met Michael yet
- Don't know his plan
- Don't know if he's committed to no layoffs
- Don't know if he understands union's role
- Don't know if he sees union as partners or obstacles

### What Would Move to 8-9?

**Jimmy's List**:
1. Michael meeting with Jimmy + bargaining committee within 30 days
2. Honest conversation about plan, risks, impact on jobs
3. Written commitment to no layoffs
4. Seat at table for ongoing planning
5. Real training budget and plan

**If These Happen**:
> "I'll go back to my members and say 'This is different. Michael's doing this right. We should support it.' That's an 8 or 9."

**If Discovery Theater Then Blindsided**:
> "That's going to be a 1 or 2, and we'll fight it."

---

## Key Quotes

**On Technology and Jobs**:
> "My first thought is 'How many jobs?' That's always the question, right?"

**On Union's Role**:
> "We're not here to block progress. We're not anti-technology or anti-change. We're here to protect our members' jobs and livelihoods."

**On Institutional Knowledge**:
> "Manufacturing isn't just machines and numbers. It's people who know the equipment, know the products, know when something's off before the gauges show it."

**On 2019 Contract**:
> "We wanted them to say 'Yes, you're valuable. Yes, we'll invest in you.' Instead, we got 'Here's 1.5%, take it or leave it.' Message received: You're a cost to be managed, not an asset to be invested in."

**On Early vs Late Involvement**:
> "Early involvement means we can shape the solution together. Late involvement means we're reacting to THEIR plan. That's the difference."

**On Strike Authorization**:
> "Strike is always the last resort. But if we authorize it and things don't improve, we WILL strike. It's not a bluff."

**On Partnership**:
> "If you involve us early, if you listen to concerns, if you work WITH us instead of around us, we can be your biggest allies."

**On Timing**:
> "Tell Michael - sooner is better than later. Don't wait until you have a polished plan. Come talk to us while it's still rough. That's when we can actually help shape it."

## Interviewer Observations

### Methodology Notes

**Five Whys Effectiveness**:
- Revealed root cause: Labor targeted because workers can organize (unlike equipment/buildings)
- Uncovered pattern: Short-term cost-cutting prioritized over long-term growth
- Exposed trust issue: Late involvement = adversarial, early involvement = collaborative

**Jobs-to-be-Done Insights**:
- Surface need: More money (3% raises)
- Underlying need: Recognition and respect ("acknowledge we're valuable")
- Union's job: Protect livelihoods AND ensure company succeeds (not mutually exclusive)

### Emotional Tone

- **Opening**: Guarded but professional (cautious, "seen this before")
- **Middle**: More animated when discussing institutional knowledge, partnership potential
- **SAP Discussion**: Bitter about broken promises, inadequate training
- **Advice to Michael**: Earnest, hopeful but realistic
- **Closing**: Clear-eyed about 5/10 confidence, specific about what would improve it

### Trust & Credibility Signals

**High Credibility**:
- Specific contract provisions cited (Articles 7, 12, 15)
- Historical examples with details (2019 QA cameras, SAP disaster, contract negotiation)
- Self-aware about union's role and limitations
- Genuinely wants company to succeed (not just obstructionist)
- Open to partnership if approached correctly

**Trust Indicators**:
- Appreciates being asked early (Phase 0)
- Respects Robert's involvement ("Robert's good people")
- Willing to advocate for Michael IF conditions met
- "This conversation right here? This is a good start. That's rare."

### Alignment with Prior Interviews

**Confirms Robert's Assessment**:
- ✅ Early union engagement is #1 priority
- ✅ Jimmy is reasonable, not radical
- ✅ Strike authorization risk if jobs threatened
- ✅ 2019 contract negotiation created tension
- ✅ Partnership approach works (Robert has good relationship)

**Confirms Sarah's Concerns**:
- ✅ SAP 2018 was disaster (inadequate training, broken promises)
- ✅ Training must be real, not token
- ✅ Floor knows what works (involve them in testing)

**Confirms Jennifer's Approach**:
- ✅ Honesty is essential ("commit to no layoffs or say you don't know yet")
- ✅ Don't make promises you can't keep
- ✅ Put commitments in writing

**New Information** (Not in Prior Interviews):
- ⚠️ Union contract requires 120-day notice (Article 12) - timeline impact
- ⚠️ Contract renewal July 2026 (18 months) - negotiation window opening
- ⚠️ Seniority rules apply to new cloud roles (Article 15) - can't just hire externally
- ⚠️ 2018 SAP trauma worse than we knew (6 months, 3 weeks lost production)
- ⚠️ Strike authorization would likely be 80-90% yes if jobs threatened (not theoretical)

### Power & Influence

**Formal Power**: 
- Represents 180 UAW workers
- Can invoke contract provisions (Articles 7, 12, 15)
- Can authorize strike vote (87% in 2019)
- Strike cost: $240K/day

**Informal Power**:
- Workers trust Jimmy (bargaining committee represents them)
- Robert respects Jimmy ("good people")
- Jimmy has institutional knowledge (long tenure)
- Can be advocate OR adversary depending on approach

**Veto Mechanism**: Active (strike authorization) if:
- Surprise layoffs
- Unsafe rollout
- Contract violations
- Refusal to negotiate

### Critical Risks Identified

**R30: Union Contract Violation** (New)
- 120-day notice required before tech changes (Article 12)
- Seniority rules apply to new roles (Article 15)
- If violated, union files grievances, potentially strikes

**R31: Strike Authorization Risk** (New)
- If jobs threatened without negotiation: 80-90% yes vote likely
- Cost: $240K/day, $1.68M/week
- Scenarios: Surprise layoffs, unsafe rollout, contract violations, bad faith

**R32: Training Adequacy** (New)
- Union contract requires "real training" not "token training"
- If training inadequate, workers can't perform new roles
- Company then can't hire externally (must offer to existing workers first per Article 15)
- Migration blocked if can't staff new roles

**R33: MES Floor Adoption** (New)
- 180 operators must adopt new/changed MES
- If interface changes significantly, productivity drops during relearning
- If support inadequate (2 AM downtime), resistance builds
- Union can work-to-rule (slow things down) if concerns not addressed

## Recommended Follow-Up Actions

### Immediate (Within 30 Days):

**1. Michael-Jimmy Meeting** (URGENT)
- Michael + Jimmy + bargaining committee
- Full transparency on plan (what's known so far)
- Honest conversation about risks, unknowns, job impacts
- Not courtesy meeting - real partnership discussion

**2. No Layoffs Commitment** (CRITICAL)
- Michael must decide: Can he commit to no layoffs?
- If yes: Put in writing, endorsed by CEO
- If no/uncertain: Say so honestly, negotiate protections
- Worst option: Vague promises that erode trust

**3. Contract Compliance Review**
- Review Articles 7, 12, 15 with legal
- Ensure migration plan complies with 120-day notice
- Understand seniority implications for new roles
- Plan for good-faith negotiations on training/redeployment

### Before Phase 1 Start:

**4. Joint Planning Framework**
- Give union seat at table for decisions affecting floor
- Regular meetings (monthly minimum)
- Transparency on timeline, systems affected, training plans
- Feedback mechanism for union concerns

**5. Training Program Design**
- Work WITH union to design retraining programs
- Real training (months-long, hands-on, paid time)
- Start with pilot group, get feedback, refine
- Budget must be realistic ($50K per person retrained, not $5K)

**6. MES Pilot Plan**
- Pilot MES migration with one production line first
- Invite volunteer operators (union helps recruit)
- 3-6 month parallel running
- Collect feedback, make adjustments
- THEN expand to full factory

### Ongoing:

**7. Labor-Management Communication**
- Regular updates to union (not just when problems arise)
- Open door policy for concerns
- Celebrate wins together (partnership success stories)
- Build trust through actions, not just words

## Discovery Progress Update

**Interviews Completed**: 6 of 11 (55%)

**Critical Themes Confirmed/Expanded**:
1. ✅ **Timeline misalignment** - Union needs 120 days notice, adds to timeline
2. ✅ **Trust deficit** - 2018 SAP + 2019 contract created skepticism
3. ✅ **No layoffs is non-negotiable** - Written commitment required
4. ✅ **Early involvement = partnership** - Late involvement = fight
5. ✅ **Training must be real** - Contract requires genuine opportunity, not token
6. ⚠️ **NEW: Contract renewal window** - July 2026, 18 months away
7. ⚠️ **NEW: Strike authorization risk** - 80-90% yes if jobs threatened
8. ⚠️ **NEW: Seniority rules for new roles** - Can't bypass existing workers

**Next Priorities**:
1. Michael-Jimmy meeting within 30 days (critical path)
2. Four-way alignment meeting (Michael + Jennifer + Robert + Sarah + Kevin) now includes union consideration
3. Remaining 5 interviews to complete discovery

**Remaining Interviews** (5 of 11):
- Support lead (customer impact)
- Quality manager (GMP/validation, regulatory)
- Manufacturing supervisor (floor-level operations)
- Sales director (customer-facing systems)
- HR director (organizational change, training capacity)
