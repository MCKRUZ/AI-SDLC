## Key Insights from Interview 3

### **Most Critical Findings:**

1. **Budget Reality Shock**
   - Michael thinks: undefined/optimistic
   - Jennifer reality: $3-5M over 3-5 years
   - Year 1 costs: $9-11M (DOUBLE baseline)
   - Savings: Year 4+, not Year 1-2

2. **Jennifer Has Veto Power**
   - Controls budget absolutely
   - Will publicly challenge unrealistic promises in board meeting
   - Quote: "If he gives them the '50% savings in 18 months' pitch, I'll be the CFO who asks uncomfortable questions"

3. **SAP Trauma is Deep and Specific**
   - $2.3M write-off + $180K production loss
   - Budget grew from $1.2M to $2.3M (92% overrun)
   - Jennifer was overruled when trying to stop it
   - Keeps the write-off memo in her drawer
   - "Won't go through it again"

4. **Trust Hierarchy**
   - Jennifer trusts Sarah (15 years, realistic)
   - Jennifer skeptical of Michael (60 days, vendor-influenced)
   - Quote: "The truth is probably somewhere between them, but closer to Sarah"

5. **30-Day Deadline**
   - Michael presenting to board in 30 days
   - MUST align with Jennifer before presentation
   - If misaligned, Jennifer will publicly challenge or recommend delay

### **Jennifer's Four Non-Negotiables:**

1. **Honest Assessment Upfront** - Complete complexity picture (shadow IT, black boxes, constraints)
2. **Realistic Budget with Contingency** - Not point estimates, ranges ($3-5M)
3. **Phased Approach with Kill Criteria** - 20% gate overage or 50% cumulative triggers stop
4. **External Validation** - Independent third party reviews plan

### **Jennifer's Additional Requirements:**

5. Retention plan ($500K approved for key staff)
6. Monthly cost reviews
7. Stage-gate CFO approval at each phase
8. CEO agreement to support kill criteria
9. Michael-Sarah-Jennifer alignment before board
10. Board expectations reset (costs up before down)

## Critical Actions Required

### **URGENT (Next 7 Days):**

1. ⚠️ **Michael-Jennifer Budget Meeting**
   - Jennifer shares her $3-5M cost model
   - Michael sees year-by-year reality (double Year 1)
   - Align on realistic budget before board

2. ⚠️ **Kill Criteria Definition**
   - 20% overage at any gate = stop
   - 50% cumulative overage = kill
   - Document in writing

3. ⚠️ **CEO Pre-Alignment** (if possible)
   - Will CEO support kill criteria this time?
   - CEO must not override Jennifer like SAP

### **CRITICAL (Before Board Presentation - 30 Days):**

4. 🚨 **Michael-Jennifer-Sarah Three-Way Alignment**
   - Jennifer facilitates between "tech optimism" and "financial reality"
   - Michael listens to Sarah, doesn't dismiss
   - Sarah engages with vision, doesn't just block
   - Align on timeline: 3-5 years realistic
   - Align on costs: Year 1 doubles, savings Year 4+

5. 🚨 **Board Presentation Draft Review**
   - Jennifer MUST approve financial messaging
   - Cannot present "50% savings in 18 months"
   - Must present honest cost curve
   - Must show 5-year ROI (strong but back-loaded)

6. 🚨 **Realistic 5-Year ROI Model**
   - Show investment phase (Year 1-2)
   - Show break-even (Year 3)
   - Show returns (Year 4+)
   - Total: $5M investment, $15M+ return

7. 🚨 **Stratton Partners Communication**
   - PE firm must understand multi-year cycle
   - Year 1 costs will increase
   - Long-term ROI is compelling

## Updated Contradictions Count

**Original (After Interview 2)**: 6 contradictions

**New (After Interview 3)**: 4 additional contradictions
1. Budget Unknown (Michael hasn't seen Jennifer's $3-5M model)
2. ROI Timeline (Michael implies quick, Jennifer shows 2-year investment)
3. Kill Criteria (Not defined, CEO must support)
4. Trust/Alignment (Michael credibility low, Jennifer trusts Sarah)

**Total**: 10 contradictions

**Critical/Existential**: 5 contradictions require resolution before board presentation:
- Cost Expectations (Michael vs. Jennifer)
- Timeline (Michael vs. Sarah vs. Jennifer)
- Budget Unknown
- Kill Criteria
- Trust/Alignment

## Updated Risk Assessment

### **Risks Elevated to CRITICAL (25/25):**

**RISK-001: Budget Cut Mid-Flight**
- **Was**: 20/25 (CRITICAL)
- **Now**: 25/25 (EXISTENTIAL)
- **Reason**: Jennifer confirmed veto power, will publicly challenge unrealistic promises
- **Mitigation**: URGENT Michael-Jennifer alignment within 7 days

### **New Risks Identified:**

**NEW RISK: CEO Override of CFO Kill Criteria**
- **Score**: 15/25 (HIGH)
- **Description**: CEO overruled Jennifer during SAP; if repeats, prevents financial discipline
- **Mitigation**: Get CEO commitment to support kill criteria before project

**NEW RISK: Board Presentation Failure**
- **Score**: 20/25 (CRITICAL)
- **Description**: Michael presents unrealistic view, Jennifer contradicts publicly, board confidence collapses
- **Mitigation**: Alignment session and presentation draft review within 30 days

---

## Updated Feasibility Assessment

### **Financial Feasibility: Was 50/100 (Uncertain) → Now 65/100 (Moderate)**

**Improved Because:**
- ✅ Detailed budget model exists ($3-5M)
- ✅ Year-by-year costs understood
- ✅ ROI is strong (3X over 5 years)
- ✅ CFO willing to approve if requirements met
- ✅ Retention plan approved ($500K)
- ✅ Phase 0 budget defined ($200K)

**Still Challenged Because:**
- ❌ Michael doesn't know budget yet
- ❌ Board doesn't know Year 1 costs double
- ❌ PE firm may not accept Year 1 increase
- ❌ Kill criteria not yet defined/approved
- ❌ External validator not selected

### **Organizational Feasibility: Remains 35/100 (Very Challenging)**

**Still Challenged:**
- ❌ Michael-Jennifer misalignment existential
- ❌ Jennifer's trust in Michael is low
- ❌ 30-day deadline creates time pressure
- ❌ If alignment fails, Jennifer recommends delay or questions Michael's fit

### **Overall Feasibility: Was 52/100 → Now 55/100 (Moderate - High Risk)**

Small improvement due to financial clarity, but organizational alignment remains critical challenge.

## Next Interview Priority

**Interview 4: Robert Turner (VP Operations)** - CRITICAL NEXT

**Why Critical:**
- CEO confidant (best friends, golf buddies)
- Controls operational constraints
- Union relationship manager
- Can influence CEO on project support/kill criteria
- Operational perspective missing from current understanding

**Key Questions:**
1. True downtime tolerance (Michael says zero, Sarah says 4 hours Sunday)
2. Union reaction to automation
3. Sacrosanct manufacturing processes
4. Relationship with Michael and Sarah
5. Influence with CEO
6. SAP experience from operations side
7. Operational ROI expectations
