### Step 2: Update Working Artifact Files

For the 5 files that need updates:

**Option A: Manual Updates (Recommended)**
1. Open each file in your project
2. Use the REMAINING-FILES-PACKAGE.md document as reference
3. Copy/paste the relevant sections

- "Please regenerate the complete stakeholder-map.md file"

**Time Investment**:
- Manual updates: ~30 minutes for all 5 files

### Step 3: Verify Cross-References

After updates, check that cross-references are consistent:

**Notes ↔ Contradictions**:
- Interview insights should align with contradictions identified
- Maria's concerns (Interview 8) should match Contradictions 7, 13, 15, 16

**Notes ↔ Risks**:
- Interview findings should support risk assessments
- New risks from Interview 8 should trace to Maria's insights

**Notes ↔ Themes**:
- Themes should be evident in interview transcripts
- Maria's interview should show Themes 11-15

**Risks ↔ Feasibility**:
- Critical risks should impact feasibility scores
- Interview 8 risks should explain -5 point decreases

**Contradictions ↔ Feasibility**:
- Contradictions should reduce feasibility
- Resolution of contradictions should improve scores

**Next Interview**: Support Lead  
**Focus Areas**:
- After-hours support capacity (24/7 operations)

## TROUBLESHOOTING

### If Files Won't Open
- Files are plain Markdown (.md) format
- Open with any text editor (VS Code, Sublime, Notepad++)
- Or use Markdown viewer (Typora, MarkText, etc.)

### If Updates Seem Overwhelming
- Start with the 3 fully regenerated files (notes, session.meta, contradictions)
- Use those to understand current state
- Apply updates to other 5 files gradually
- Or request specific file regeneration if preferred

### If Cross-References Break
- Each file should be self-contained
- Cross-references are for convenience, not required
- Priority: Content accuracy over perfect linking

### If You Need Specific Content
Example requests:
- "Show me all critical risks from Interview 8"
- "What are the key contradictions from Maria's interview?"
- "What's the updated budget breakdown?"
- "What are the success conditions for go/no-go?"
