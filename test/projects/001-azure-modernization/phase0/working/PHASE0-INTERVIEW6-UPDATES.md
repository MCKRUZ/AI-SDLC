## 🚨 Critical Discoveries from Interview 6

### 1. Union Contract Article 12 - Legal Requirement

**Finding**: 120-day notice REQUIRED before major tech changes affecting union members.

**Impact**:
- Adds 4 months to timeline (between Phase 1 planning and Phase 2 execution)
- MES, ERP floor interfaces, shop floor systems ALL require notice
- This is legal requirement, not optional
- Union gets review/negotiation rights during notice period
- Cannot be short-cut by claiming "just IT infrastructure"

**Action Required**:
- Build into timeline immediately
- Legal review of all system changes
- Good-faith negotiation during 120-day period

---

### 2. No-Layoffs Commitment - THE Non-Negotiable

**Finding**: Jimmy states "No layoffs is THE non-negotiable - everything else is negotiable if this is guaranteed."

**Impact**:
- Without written commitment (CEO-endorsed): Strike authorization likely (80-90% yes vote)
- With commitment: Partnership possible, Jimmy moves from 5/10 to 8-9/10 confidence
- This is the single most important decision Michael must make

**Action Required**:
- Michael must decide: Can he commit to no layoffs?
- If YES: Put in writing, endorsed by CEO, communicate to union
- If NO/UNCERTAIN: Honest conversation, negotiate protections
- Worst option: Vague promises that erode trust
- URGENT: Decision needed before Michael-Jimmy meeting (within 30 days)

---

### 3. Real Training vs. Token Training

**Finding**: Union contract requires "real training" not "token training".

**Real Training Definition** (Jimmy):
- $50K per person (not $5K token)
- Months-long programs (not 2-day workshops)
- Dedicated instructors, hands-on practice
- Paid time (regular wage while training)
- Fair opportunity to learn

**Impact**:
- If 20-30 workers need retraining: $1-1.5M (NOT $100-150K)
- Budget shortfall: $900K-1.35M unbudgeted
- Article 15 (seniority) prevents external hiring until existing workers trained first
- If training inadequate: Cannot staff cloud roles, migration blocked

**Action Required**:
- Budget realistic training ($50K/person)
- Design WITH union (what does "real training" look like?)
- Pilot program with volunteers
- Document good-faith effort for contract compliance

---

### 4. Strike Authorization Risk - Not Theoretical

**Finding**: Jimmy estimates 80-90% strike authorization vote if jobs threatened (87% in 2019 wage fight).

**Strike Cost**: $240K/day production loss, $1.68M/week

**Scenarios Triggering Strike**:
- Surprise layoffs
- Contract violations (Article 12 no notice)
- Unsafe system rollout
- Bad-faith negotiations
- Broken promises

**Impact**:
- Production halt
- Damages company reputation
- Robert vetoes via CEO (cannot tolerate risk)
- Board loses confidence
- Initiative cancelled to restore labor peace

**Action Required**:
- Early union engagement (Phase 0, before decisions locked)
- Partnership mindset, not adversarial compliance
- Michael-Jimmy meeting within 30 days (URGENT)

---

### 5. 2018 SAP Trauma - Worse Than We Knew

**Finding**: Union perspective on SAP disaster reveals 3 WEEKS lost production (not days), 6-month nightmare, inadequate training (2-hour overview).

**Impact on Current Initiative**:
- Union remembers broken promises
- Trust deficit must be overcome
- Floor operators skeptical of any "new system"
- Adequate training non-negotiable
- Parallel running extended (3-6 months for MES, not 90 days)

**Action Required**:
- Acknowledge SAP trauma explicitly
- Show this time is different (early engagement, real training, no-layoffs commitment)
- Learn from SAP mistakes (Jimmy detailed them in interview)

---

### 6. Seniority Rules (Article 15) - Cannot Bypass

**Finding**: All job assignments based on seniority. New cloud roles MUST be offered to existing workers first with real training.

**Impact**:
- Cannot lay off 12-year worker and hire college grad for "cloud engineer" role
- Violates contract even if technically following letter
- Must offer roles to existing workers, provide real training, THEN (and only then) consider external hiring
- If skip this step: Grievances, potential strike

**Action Required**:
- Seniority-compliant staffing approach
- Real training first, external hiring last resort
- Document good-faith effort

---

### 7. Contract Renewal - July 2026 (18 Months)

**Finding**: Union contract renews July 2026, negotiation window opening.

**Impact**:
- Technology changes happening during contract term must comply with current contract
- Contract renewal adds complexity if migration coincides
- Opportunity to negotiate technology change provisions if needed
- Timing considerations for major floor system migrations

**Action Required**:
- Awareness of contract renewal timing
- Consider migration timing relative to contract negotiations
- Opportunity for partnership discussions during renewal

---

### 8. Early Involvement = Partnership vs. Late Involvement = Fight

**Finding**: Jimmy's key message: "Early involvement = partnership; late involvement = adversarial fight."

**Michael's Current State**: Has NOT met with Jimmy or bargaining committee yet.

**Impact**:
- Phase 0 interview appreciated by Jimmy ("This is rare. This is a good start.")
- BUT: Meeting and partnership must happen before decisions locked
- If union learns about plans through grapevine: Adversarial mode
- If union shaped at table: Partnership mode

**Action Required**:
- **URGENT**: Michael + Jimmy + bargaining committee meeting within 30 days
- Give union seat at table for ongoing decisions
- Monthly meetings minimum
- Transparent communication

## 💡 Key Insights from Interview 6

### What Went Well

✅ **Jimmy is open to partnership** - "This conversation right here? This is a good start. That's rare."

✅ **Early Phase 0 engagement appreciated** - Union typically learns about plans after decisions made

✅ **Jimmy is reasonable, not radical** - "Union wants company to succeed. Company failure = job loss anyway."

✅ **Partnership roadmap clear** - Jimmy detailed exactly what would move confidence from 5/10 to 8-9/10

✅ **Robert's relationship with Jimmy confirmed** - "Robert's good people"

### What's Concerning

⚠️ **Union not engaged yet beyond this interview** - Michael hasn't met with Jimmy or bargaining committee

⚠️ **No-layoffs decision not made** - THE non-negotiable is still undecided

⚠️ **120-day notice not built into timeline** - Legal requirement adds 4 months

⚠️ **Real training not budgeted** - $1-1.5M shortfall

⚠️ **Seniority compliance not planned** - Can't hire externally until existing workers trained first

⚠️ **Strike authorization is real** - 80-90% yes vote likely if jobs threatened, not theoretical

⚠️ **SAP trauma deeper than we knew** - 3 weeks lost production, 6-month nightmare, union hasn't forgotten

### Opportunities

💡 **Partnership is possible** - IF Michael engages now, commits to no layoffs, provides real training

💡 **Union can be advocate** - Jimmy: "If you involve us early, if you listen, if you work WITH us, we can be your biggest allies."

💡 **Floor operator knowledge valuable** - Operators know what works, can prevent mistakes

💡 **Early Phase 0 engagement is winning trust** - Interview appreciated, rare to be asked

💡 **Clear requirements** - Union's needs are explicit, achievable if Michael commits

### Threats

🚨 **Strike authorization likely if mishandled** - 80-90% yes vote if jobs threatened

🚨 **Contract violations trigger grievances** - Article 12 notice is legal requirement

🚨 **Late engagement = adversarial fight** - Window closing for partnership approach

🚨 **Token training violates contract** - $5K workshops won't suffice, need $50K real programs

🚨 **Timeline adds 4 months** - 120-day notice not optional

🚨 **Budget increases $1-1.5M** - Real training cost not currently budgeted

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

### Immediate (This Week)

1. Schedule Michael-Jimmy-bargaining committee meeting (within 30 days)
2. Schedule five-way alignment meeting (within 2 weeks)
3. Legal review of union contract (Articles 7, 12, 15)
4. No-layoffs decision process (Michael + CEO)

### Next Interview (Interview 7)

**Recommended**: Quality Manager (GMP/Validation, Regulatory)

**Why**: 
- Medical device and defense contractor requirements
- Validation requirements for regulated systems
- Compliance risk if changes not properly documented
- Timeline impact of validation processes
- Better to know early in discovery

**Alternative**: Support Lead (customer-facing systems, downtime impact)
