            <h2>Key Discoveries from This Interview</h2>
            
            <div class="finding-card">
                <h4>Discovery #1: Training Budget Shock ($9M for operators alone)</h4>
                <p><strong>What We Learned:</strong> MES operator training will cost $9M (180 operators × $50K each), likely $12-15M total across all roles</p>
                
                <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Original budget model had $300-500K for ALL training. Actual requirement is 2400-5000% higher. Training alone is 60-65% of total project budget.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Breakdown:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Classroom training: 2 weeks per production line</li>
                    <li>Hands-on practice: 3-month pilot on one line</li>
                    <li>Gradual rollout: ~2 months per line (2 weeks training + 6 weeks stabilization)</li>
                    <li>24/7 support: 6 months post-rollout per line</li>
                    <li>Total per operator: $50K (training time + reduced productivity + support)</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Budget increased from $5.5-9.5M to $16.5-23.5M, feasibility score dropped 5 points</p>
            </div>

            <div class="finding-card">
                <h4>Discovery #2: Sunday Window Math (Physical Timeline Constraint)</h4>
                <p><strong>What We Learned:</strong> Only 48 hours per year available for system cutovers (Sunday 2-6 AM windows)</p>
                
                <p><strong>The Mathematics:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Available windows: Sunday 2:00 AM - 6:00 AM (4 hours)</li>
                    <li>Cannot use: 1st Sunday (preventive maintenance), 5th Sunday (extended maintenance)</li>
                    <li>Actual availability: ~12 Sundays per year × 4 hours = 48 hours/year</li>
                    <li>Systems to migrate: 8 critical systems</li>
                    <li>Time per system: 6 hours average (cutover + validation + rollback buffer)</li>
                    <li><strong>Calculation: 8 systems × 6 hours = 48 hours minimum = 1 year perfect execution</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Reality: 3-5 years accounting for parallel running, validation, issues</strong></li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> This is a mathematical proof, not an estimate. The 18-month timeline is physically impossible.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Provided irrefutable evidence that timeline must be 36-60 months. Converted timeline from negotiable to physics.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="finding-card">
                <h4>Discovery #3: SAP Trauma as Organizational PTSD</h4>
                <p><strong>What We Learned:</strong> 2018 SAP failure created lasting organizational trauma affecting this initiative</p>
                
                <p><strong>SAP Failure Details (From Maria):</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Duration:</strong> 3 weeks of operational chaos</li>
                    <li><strong>Production Impact:</strong> 50% production drop during chaos period</li>
                    <li><strong>People Impact:</strong> 3 employees lost (1 quit during, 2 quit after), nervous breakdown of 1 person</li>
                    <li><strong>Floor Impact:</strong> Operators working paper and pencil, entering data later, massive overtime</li>
                    <li><strong>Trust Impact:</strong> 7 years later, "new system" = resume updates</li>
                    <li><strong>Lasting Effect:</strong> "We're not doing that again" is universal floor response</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p><strong>Key Quote:</strong></p>
                <div class="quote-box">
                    "When corporate says 'new system,' people update their resumes. That's the legacy of SAP. You're not fighting technology. You're fighting trauma."
                    <cite>— Maria Rodriguez</cite>
                </div>
                
                <p><strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Cannot ignore or minimize SAP. Must explicitly acknowledge, demonstrate learning, and rebuild trust through partnership.</p>
                
                <p><strong>Impact:</strong> Added SAP trauma as CRITICAL RISK (20/25), identified need for explicit SAP retrospective and lessons learned documentation</p>

                "You can have the best technology in the world. But if my operators don't trust it, don't understand it, or can't use it, it's worthless. This is a people project that happens to involve technology."

            <h2>Operator Capability Breakdown (Maria's Assessment)</h2>
            <p>Maria provided a realistic assessment of her 180 MES operators' technology readiness:</p>
            
            <h3>Group 1: Comfortable with Technology (1/3 of operators, ~60 people)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Younger operators (under 40)</li>
                <li>Grew up with computers and smartphones</li>
                <li>Will adapt quickly to new MES (2-4 weeks)</li>
                <li>Actually prefer digital to paper</li>
                <li>Can help train others</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Group 2: Can Learn But Will Struggle (1/3 of operators, ~60 people)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Older operators (40-60)</li>
                <li>Computer literate but not comfortable</li>
                <li>Will adapt with proper training and support (6-12 weeks)</li>
                <li>Need hands-on practice, not classroom lectures</li>
                <li>Will reach competence but need ongoing support</li>
                <li>Productivity drop of 30% for 2-3 months</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Group 3: Will Struggle Significantly (1/3 of operators, ~60 people)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Senior operators (55+)</li>
                <li>25+ years at company, know machines perfectly</li>
                <li>Limited computer experience ("hunt and peck" typing)</li>
                <li>Will require extensive training and support (3-6 months to baseline)</li>
                <li>Some may never reach full competence</li>
                <li>Some may choose to retire rather than learn new system</li>
                <li>Losing these operators = losing 25 years of machine knowledge</li>
            </ul>

            <div class="alert alert-warning">
                <h3>Critical Implication</h3>
                <p><strong>Training must account for all three groups.</strong> Cannot assume "2-week training and you're done." Group 3 requires 3-6 months of intensive support. Budget must reflect this reality.</p>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>MES Migration Timeline (Maria's Breakdown)</h2>
            <p>Maria provided detailed timeline for MES migration based on her experience and operator capability assessment:</p>
            
            <h3>Phase 1: Design & Preparation (Months 1-3)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>New MES system design and configuration</li>
                <li>Training materials development</li>
                <li>Trainer sourcing (manufacturing-experienced trainers, 4-6 month lead time)</li>
                <li>Pilot line selection (Line 2, simplest products)</li>
                <li>Volunteer operator recruitment</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Phase 2: Pilot Program (Months 4-6)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Line 2 operators (20 people) classroom training (2 weeks)</li>
                <li>Practice environment hands-on (2 weeks)</li>
                <li>Parallel running (both old and new MES, 3 months)</li>
                <li>Issue identification and resolution</li>
                <li>Refinement of training materials</li>
                <li><strong>Success criteria:</strong> Line 2 at 95%+ productivity on new MES</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Phase 3: Line 1 Rollout (Months 7-9)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Line 1 operators (60 people) training (2 weeks)</li>
                <li>Cutover during Sunday window</li>
                <li>2 months hand-holding period (trainers on floor 24/7)</li>
                <li>4 weeks stabilization</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Phase 4: Line 3 Rollout (Months 10-12)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Line 3 operators (100 people) training (2 weeks)</li>
                <li>Cutover during Sunday window</li>
                <li>2 months hand-holding period</li>
                <li>4 weeks stabilization</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Phase 5: Post-Rollout Support (Months 13-18)</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>24/7 support team on-site</li>
                <li>Refresher training for struggling operators</li>
                <li>Workflow optimization</li>
                <li>Documentation updates</li>
                <li>Continuous improvement</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Total Timeline: 18-24 months for MES alone</strong> (from design to stable operations)</p>
            
            <div class="alert alert-critical">
                <h3>⚠️ Critical: MES Must Be Migrated LAST</h3>
                <p>MES is highest-risk system ($10K+/minute downtime). All other systems (ERP, WMS, email, etc.) must be stable BEFORE attempting MES migration. Cannot risk production disruption while other systems are unstable.</p>

        <section class="content-section">
            <h2>Michael's Five Requirements (Per Maria)</h2>
            <p>Maria laid out five non-negotiable requirements for Michael to gain floor credibility and trust:</p>
            
            <ol style="font-size: 1.1rem; line-height: 1.8;">
                <li><strong>Work a Floor Shift:</strong> 8 hours on 2nd or 3rd shift, actually doing the work (enter work orders, handle system issues at 2 AM, talk to 20-year veterans)</li>
                
                <li><strong>Listen to Floor Input:</strong> Operators know the workflows, the workarounds, the edge cases. Design WITH them, not AT them.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Commit to Training:</strong> Not 2-week classroom training. Real, comprehensive, hands-on training with ongoing support. Budget must reflect reality ($50K per operator).</li>
                
                <li><strong>No Layoffs:</strong> Explicit commitment in writing. Some operators may retire, but no forced layoffs due to automation/efficiency.</li>
                
                <li><strong>Acknowledge SAP:</strong> Don't pretend it didn't happen. Document what went wrong, what's different this time, how you'll avoid repeating mistakes.</li>
            </ol>

            <div class="recommendation-box">
                <h3>Maria's Bottom Line</h3>
                <p>"We're not the enemy. We're not resisting change because we're stubborn or lazy or afraid. We're cautious because we've been burned before. We're protective because these systems are critical to our jobs and to the company's success."</p>
                
                <p>"If you partner with us—really partner, not just pretend to involve us—we'll make this work. My operators are smart, capable, adaptable people. Give them real training, real support, and real respect, and they'll deliver."</p>
                
                <p>"But if you treat this like a technical project instead of a people project, it will fail. The technology might work fine, but the people won't adopt it, and you'll have spent millions for nothing."</p>

            <h2>Impact on Project</h2>
            
            <h3>Budget Impact</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Training costs increased from $300-500K to $12-15M</li>
                <li>Total project budget increased from $5.5-9.5M to $16.5-23.5M</li>
                <li>Training now represents 60-65% of total budget</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Timeline Impact</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Sunday window constraint proves 3-5 year minimum timeline</li>
                <li>MES alone requires 18-24 months (pilot through stabilization)</li>
                <li>MES must be migrated LAST (after all other systems stable)</li>
                <li>Converted timeline from estimate to mathematical proof</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Approach Impact</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Michael floor shift elevated to CRITICAL success factor</li>
                <li>Partnership approach (vs top-down mandate) now explicit requirement</li>
                <li>Floor operator input must be integral to design</li>
                <li>SAP lessons learned documentation required</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Risk Impact</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Added RISK-034: SAP Trauma Organizational PTSD (20/25 CRITICAL)</li>
                <li>Added RISK-035: Safety Incidents During Transition (15/25 HIGH)</li>
