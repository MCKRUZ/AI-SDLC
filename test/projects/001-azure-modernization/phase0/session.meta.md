## Session Notes

### Interview 8 Major Updates
**Date**: 2025-11-05  
**Interview**: Maria Rodriguez (MES Supervisor)  
**Impact**: Highest-impact interview - fundamentally changed understanding

**Key Revelations**:
1. **Training Budget Shock**: $9M for MES operators alone (180 × $50K), likely $12-15M total across all roles
2. **Sunday Window Math**: Only 48 hours/year for ALL changes, proves multi-year timeline independent of other factors
3. **SAP Trauma Depth**: 3 employees lost, 7 years later still organizational PTSD, "people update resumes when corporate says 'new system'"
4. **MES Timeline Reality**: 18-24 months for MES alone (pilot through stabilization), must be migrated LAST
5. **Safety Incidents Risk**: Operator confusion during SAP led to safety hazards and near-miss quality failures

**Feasibility Score Changes**:
- Operational: 55 → 50 (-5 points)
- Financial: 45 → 40 (-5 points)
- Timeline: 30 → 25 (-5 points)
- Overall: 43 → 38 (-5 points)

**New Risks** (4):
- RISK-034: SAP Trauma Organizational PTSD (20/25 CRITICAL)
- RISK-035: Safety Incidents During Transition (15/25 HIGH)
- RISK-036: Sunday Window Capacity Constraint (15/25 HIGH)
- RISK-037: Training Budget Inadequacy (16/25 HIGH)

**Risk Updates** (1):
- RISK-033: MES Floor Adoption Resistance (16 → 20/25, now CRITICAL)

**New Themes** (5):
- THEME 11: SAP Trauma as Organizational PTSD
- THEME 12: Training as Investment vs. Expense
- THEME 13: Sunday Window Constraint as Timeline Reality
- THEME 14: Floor-Level Partnership as Success Prerequisite
- THEME 15: Safety and Quality as Non-Negotiable Veto

**New Contradictions** (3):
- CONTRADICTION 14: Training Budget (nominal vs. $12-15M reality)
- CONTRADICTION 15: MES Migration Timeline (concurrent vs. must be last)
- CONTRADICTION 16: Floor Worker Capability (tech adoption vs. training quality determines success)
