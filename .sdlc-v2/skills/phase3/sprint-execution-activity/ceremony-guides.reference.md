# Sprint Ceremony Guides

## Overview

Sprint ceremonies are structured meetings that enable effective Scrum.
Each ceremony has a specific purpose and format.

---

## Daily Standup

### Purpose

Synchronize the team and surface blockers quickly.

### Format

| Aspect | Guideline |
|--------|-----------|
| Duration | 15 minutes maximum |
| Frequency | Daily, same time |
| Attendees | Development team |
| Location | Standing (keeps it short) |

### Three Questions

Each team member answers:

1. **What did I complete yesterday?**
   - Specific tasks/stories
   - Not "worked on X"

2. **What will I work on today?**
   - Planned focus
   - Expected completions

3. **Any blockers?**
   - What's preventing progress
   - What help is needed

### Facilitation Tips

- Start on time regardless of attendance
- Keep it brief - details offline
- Note blockers for follow-up
- Avoid problem-solving in standup
- Use a timer if needed

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

| Anti-Pattern | Problem | Solution |
|--------------|---------|----------|
| Status report to manager | Not collaborative | Speak to team, not SM |
| Problem-solving | Goes long | "Let's take that offline" |
| Late starts | Wastes time | Start on time always |
| Seated meetings | Goes long | Stand up |
| Deep technical discussion | Excludes some | Parking lot |
