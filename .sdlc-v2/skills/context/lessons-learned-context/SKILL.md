# Lessons Learned Context

## Purpose

Capture and apply organizational learning from past projects.

## Usage

1. Review before starting new phases
2. Add lessons as they emerge
3. Reference when making similar decisions
4. Use [lessons.template.md](lessons.template.md) to document new lessons

## Categories

### Discovery Lessons
- Interview techniques that work
- Common stakeholder dynamics
- Patterns in problem identification

### Specification Lessons
- Requirements quality issues
- Architecture decisions that aged well/poorly
- Estimation accuracy patterns

### Planning Lessons
- Sprint planning accuracy
- Common dependency issues
- Resource allocation patterns

### Implementation Lessons
- Technical debt patterns
- Testing strategies that work
- Deployment challenges

## How to Add Lessons

After each project or significant event:
1. What happened?
2. What did we learn?
3. What should we do differently?
4. What should we keep doing?

## When to Load

- Start of any phase (review relevant lessons)
- When making decisions similar to past situations
- During retrospectives
- When onboarding team members
