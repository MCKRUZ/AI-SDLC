# CONSUMER MOBILE APP DISCOVERY ADDENDUM

## Additional Questions to Ask
- **User Behavior**:
  - "When and where do users need this? (context of use)"
  - "What's the frequency of use (daily, weekly, monthly)?"
  - "What triggers users to open the app?"
  - "What's the competition for user attention?"

- **Monetization**:
  - "How will this make money (subscription, ads, in-app purchases)?"
  - "What's the free vs paid feature mix?"
  - "What's the conversion funnel from install to paying user?"

- **Platform**:
  - "iOS, Android, or both? What's the priority?"
  - "Native, hybrid, or web-based?"
  - "What device capabilities are needed (camera, GPS, notifications)?"

## Mobile-Specific Constraints

- Platform-specific guidelines (Apple, Google)
- Device fragmentation (screen sizes, OS versions)
- Offline functionality needs
- Battery and performance impact
