| 4 | High | 50-75% probability | Likely; several indicators; occurred on some similar projects |
| 3 | Medium | 25-50% probability | May or may not occur; some indicators present |
| 2 | Low | 10-25% probability | Unlikely but possible; few indicators present |
| 1 | Very Low | <10% probability | Very unlikely; no clear indicators |

### Impact Scale

| Score | Level | Description | Schedule Impact | Budget Impact | Other Impact |

## Risk Escalation Process

### Level 1: Team Level (Risks Score 6-11)

**Who Handles**: Development team with PM oversight

**Process**:

- Mitigation not effective
- Resources needed beyond team

### Level 2: Project Manager Level (Risks Score 12-15)

**Who Handles**: Project Manager with technical leads

**Process**:
1. PM convenes risk response meeting
2. Detailed mitigation plan created
3. Resources allocated (budget/people)
4. May adjust schedule or scope
5. Regular (weekly) monitoring
6. Report to stakeholders

**Escalate to Level 3 if**:
- Risk score increases to 16+
- Mitigation requires significant budget/schedule changes
- Strategic decisions needed
- Multiple high risks converging

### Level 3: Executive Level (Risks Score 16+)

**Who Handles**: Executive sponsor with PM and leadership

**Process**:
1. PM prepares executive briefing
2. Emergency meeting with exec sponsor
3. Strategic decisions made:
   - Significant budget increase
   - Major schedule change
   - Scope reduction
   - Project pivot or cancellation
4. Communication plan to broader org

## Notes and Guidance

### Using This Risk Register

**DO**:
- Update the register weekly (minimum)
- Document all significant risks (score 6+)
- Be honest about probability and impact
- Create concrete mitigation plans
- Track mitigation task progress
- Close risks when truly resolved
- Learn from risks that materialize

**DON'T**:
- Let the register get stale (it's a living document)
- Ignore risks hoping they'll go away
- Be overly optimistic in risk scoring
- Create vague mitigation plans like "be careful"
- Skip risk reviews because "everything is fine"
- Track every tiny possible issue (focus on significant risks)
- Blame people when risks occur (focus on learning)

### Risk Management Best Practices

1. **Identify Early and Often**: The best time to find a risk is before it becomes a problem
2. **Be Realistic**: Don't downplay risks to look good - face reality
3. **Act Proactively**: Address high risks immediately, don't wait
4. **Communicate Transparently**: Stakeholders need to know about significant risks
5. **Monitor Continuously**: Risk conditions change - stay vigilant
6. **Learn and Adapt**: Each risk is a learning opportunity
7. **Balance Rigor with Pragmatism**: Don't make risk management overhead, make it valuable

### Common Pitfalls

- **Ignoring the register**: Creating it once then never updating it
- **Too many risks**: Tracking 100+ risks is unmanageable - focus on significant ones
- **Vague descriptions**: "Something might go wrong" isn't actionable
- **No ownership**: Risks need clear owners who will drive mitigation
- **No follow-through**: Creating mitigation plans but not executing them
- **Risk aversion paralysis**: Some risk is inevitable - balance mitigation with progress

---

**Remember: Risk management is about being prepared, not being perfect. The goal is to know what could go wrong, have plans ready, and adapt as conditions change. This register is your tool for making informed decisions and protecting project success.**
