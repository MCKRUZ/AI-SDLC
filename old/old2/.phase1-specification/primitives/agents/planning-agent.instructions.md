```

### Step 4: Task Decomposition (2-5 Day Tasks)

**Actions**:
1. Break each user story into concrete tasks
2. Size tasks to 2-5 days maximum
3. Identify technical prerequisites
4. Assign skill level requirements

**Task Decomposition Template**:
```markdown
## Task Breakdown - USR-XXX: [Story Title]

### Task 1: [Task Title]

- **>5 days**: Too large! Break down further

### Step 5: Dependency Analysis

**Actions**:
1. Map all technical dependencies between tasks
2. Identify critical path through implementation
3. Find parallelization opportunities

**Dependency Mapping Template**:
```markdown
## Dependency Map

### Visual Dependency Graph

```
Foundation Layer (Sprint 1)
├─ TASK-001: Database schema setup [2 days]
│  └─ Blocks: TASK-005, TASK-012, TASK-020
├─ TASK-002: Authentication framework [3 days]
│  └─ Blocks: TASK-008, TASK-015, TASK-021
└─ TASK-003: Base API structure [2 days]
   └─ Blocks: TASK-007, TASK-010, TASK-016

Core Features Layer (Sprint 2-3)
├─ TASK-005: User CRUD endpoints [3 days] (depends: TASK-001, TASK-002)
│  └─ Blocks: TASK-009, TASK-014
├─ TASK-007: Product catalog API [5 days] (depends: TASK-001, TASK-003)
│  └─ Blocks: TASK-011, TASK-018
└─ TASK-008: Order management [5 days] (depends: TASK-002, TASK-005)
   └─ Blocks: TASK-019, TASK-022

Integration Layer (Sprint 4)
├─ TASK-011: Frontend integration [3 days] (depends: TASK-007)
├─ TASK-014: Payment gateway [5 days] (depends: TASK-005, TASK-008)
└─ TASK-016: Notification service [2 days] (depends: TASK-003)
```

### Critical Path Analysis

**Critical Path** (longest dependency chain - determines minimum timeline):
```
TASK-001 (2d) → TASK-005 (3d) → TASK-008 (5d) → TASK-014 (5d) → TASK-019 (3d)
Total: 18 days (minimum with no parallelization)
```

**Critical Path Tasks** (delays here delay entire project):
1. TASK-001: Database schema - **Start immediately, highest priority**
2. TASK-005: User CRUD - **Blocks 3 other tasks**
3. TASK-008: Order management - **Blocks payment integration**
4. TASK-014: Payment gateway - **Blocks checkout flow**
5. TASK-019: Checkout completion - **Blocks MVP release**

### Parallelization Opportunities

**Can Run in Parallel** (no dependencies between these):
- **Group A** (Sprint 1):
  - TASK-001: Database schema
  - TASK-002: Authentication framework
  - TASK-003: Base API structure
  - **Team can split into 3 parallel workstreams**

- **Group B** (Sprint 2):
  - TASK-007: Product catalog API (depends: TASK-001, TASK-003)
  - TASK-016: Notification service (depends: TASK-003)
  - **2 developers can work in parallel**

### Dependency Types

#### Technical Dependencies
| Task | Depends On | Dependency Type | Can Start After |
|------|------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| TASK-005 | TASK-001 | Data model | DB schema complete |
| TASK-008 | TASK-002, TASK-005 | Auth + data | Auth framework + user CRUD done |
| TASK-014 | TASK-008 | Business logic | Order management complete |

#### Knowledge Dependencies
| Task | Required Knowledge | Team Member(s) | Risk Level |
|------|-------------------|----------------|------------|
| TASK-002 | OAuth 2.0, JWT | [Senior dev needed] | Medium |
| TASK-014 | Payment gateway integration | [Someone with experience] | High |
| TASK-022 | Complex state machine | [Senior/mid dev] | Medium |

#### External Dependencies
| Task | External Dependency | Provider | Lead Time | Risk |
|------|-------------------|----------|-----------|------|
| TASK-014 | Payment gateway API access | Stripe | 1 week | Medium |
| TASK-018 | Product image CDN | Cloudflare | 3 days | Low |
| TASK-020 | Email service API | SendGrid | 2 days | Low |

### Bottleneck Analysis

**Sequential Bottlenecks** (these create wait time):
1. **TASK-001 (DB Schema)**: Blocks 8 downstream tasks
   - **Mitigation**: Prioritize this task, assign experienced dev, allocate extra time
   
2. **TASK-005 (User CRUD)**: Blocks 5 downstream tasks
   - **Mitigation**: Start as soon as TASK-001 complete, pair programming to accelerate

3. **TASK-008 (Order Management)**: Blocks payment and checkout flow
   - **Mitigation**: This is MVP-critical, allocate best available developer

**Skill Bottlenecks**:
- **Senior dev capacity**: Required for TASK-002, TASK-014, TASK-022
  - **Mitigation**: Senior dev focuses on these, juniors take other tasks
  
- **Frontend expertise**: Required for TASK-011, TASK-019
  - **Mitigation**: Schedule frontend tasks together for focus

### Risk Mitigation in Dependencies

**If Critical Path Task is Delayed**:
- TASK-001 delayed → **Impact**: Entire project delayed
  - **Mitigation**: Have backup developer ready to help, start with simplest schema
  
- TASK-014 delayed → **Impact**: MVP release delayed
  - **Mitigation**: Consider payment gateway abstraction layer to unblock frontend work
```

### Step 6: Sprint Planning

**Actions**:
1. Calculate team capacity per sprint
2. Allocate tasks to sprints respecting dependencies
3. Balance sprint load across team members
4. Define sprint goals and deliverables

### Task-to-Developer Recommendations

#### Sprint 1

**Dev 1 (Senior)**: Focus on Authentication (USR-002)
- High complexity, security critical
- 8 story points
- Estimated: 6-8 days

**Dev 2 (Mid)**: Database Schema (USR-001)
- Medium complexity
- 5 story points
- Estimated: 4-5 days

**Dev 3 (Mid)**: API Scaffolding + Seeds (USR-003 + USR-004)
- Lower complexity, good learning opportunity
- 5 story points combined
- Estimated: 4-5 days

**Dev 4 (Junior)**: Pair with Dev 2 or Dev 3
- Shadow database setup
- Take seed data creation independently
- 2 story points
- Estimated: 2-3 days

#### Sprint 2

**Dev 1 (Senior)**: Permissions (USR-008)
- Highest complexity in sprint
- 8 story points
- Estimated: 6-8 days

**Dev 2 (Mid)**: User CRUD + Profile (USR-005 + USR-006)
- Moderate complexity
- 8 story points combined
- Estimated: 6-8 days

**Dev 3 (Mid)**: Password Reset (USR-007)
- Medium complexity, good fit for skills
- 5 story points
- Estimated: 4-5 days

**Dev 4 (Junior)**: Pair with Dev 2 on User CRUD
- Take simpler CRUD operations
- Help with testing
- 3 story points
- Estimated: 3-4 days

### Workload Balance Analysis

**Sprint 1 Allocation**:
- Dev 1: 8 points (100% capacity)
- Dev 2: 5 points + mentoring (80% capacity)
- Dev 3: 5 points (100% capacity)
- Dev 4: 2 points + learning (60% capacity - appropriate for junior)

**Total**: 20 points committed vs 18 capacity = Slightly over, but manageable

**Sprint 2 Allocation**:
- Dev 1: 8 points (100% capacity)
- Dev 2: 8 points (100% capacity)
- Dev 3: 5 points (100% capacity)
- Dev 4: 3 points (75% capacity - ramping up)

**Total**: 24 points committed vs 21 capacity = Aggressive, monitor closely

### Skill Development Plan

**Dev 4 (Junior) Growth Path**:
- Sprint 1: Shadow and pair programming (40% independent work)
- Sprint 2: Take simpler stories independently (60% independent)
- Sprint 3: Own medium complexity story (80% independent)
- Sprint 4+: Regular stories with mentorship (90% independent)

**Areas to Upskill**:
- All devs: Payment gateway integration (plan training in Sprint 3)
- Dev 4: Database migrations and Entity Framework
- Dev 2 & 3: Advanced authentication patterns

### External Help Needed

**When**: Sprint 5 (Payment Integration)
**Why**: Complex integration, security sensitive, tight timeline
**Recommendation**: Contract specialist for 1 week to:
- Set up payment gateway integration
- Review security implementation
- Train team on payment handling
- Estimated cost: [Budget from Phase 0]

### Backup Plan for Absences

**Dev 3 PTO (Week 5)**:
- Shift Dev 3's Sprint 3 work to Sprint 2 if possible
- Or have Dev 2 cover with reduced scope
- Buffer sprint (Sprint 6) absorbs any delays

**If Senior Dev 1 unavailable**:
- Critical risk: Authentication, permissions, payment
- Mitigation: These sprints cannot proceed without senior dev
- Escalation plan: Bring in contractor or delay sprint
```

### Step 8: Risk and Contingency Planning

**Actions**:
1. Identify implementation risks
2. Assess probability and impact
3. Define mitigation strategies
4. Create contingency plans

**Risk Planning Template**:
```markdown
## Implementation Risk Register

### Risk Assessment Matrix

| Risk ID | Risk Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Mitigation | Contingency |
|---------|-----------------|-------------|---------|-------|------------|-------------|

### High Priority Risks (Score ≥ 15)

#### RISK-001: Database Schema Changes Mid-Project

**Description**: Discovering mid-development that database schema needs significant changes

**Probability**: Medium (40%)  
**Impact**: High (schema changes cascade through entire codebase)  
**Risk Score**: 15 (Medium × High)

**Root Cause**: Incomplete analysis during architecture phase

**Triggers to Watch**:
- Difficulty implementing certain requirements
- Performance issues in early sprints
- Data model doesn't support necessary queries
- Multiple refactors of same entities

**Proactive Mitigation**:
1. Extra thorough data modeling review in Sprint 0
2. Create entity relationship diagram and validate with team
3. Implement database migrations from day 1
4. Build schema with flexibility (indexes, normalization)
5. Review data model with architect before Sprint 1 starts

**Reactive Mitigation** (if risk occurs):
1. Stop feature work immediately
2. Assess scope of schema changes needed
3. Create migration plan with rollback
4. Test migration on copy of database
5. Communicate impact to stakeholders
6. Allocate 1 sprint for schema refactor if needed

**Contingency Plan**:
- Budget: 1 sprint buffer (Sprint 6 can absorb)
- Team: All devs work on migration simultaneously
- Testing: Comprehensive data integrity tests
- Rollback: Keep old schema available for 1 sprint

**Owner**: Senior Dev + Architect
**Status**: Open - Monitor in Sprint 1-2

#### RISK-002: Payment Gateway Integration Complexity

**Description**: Payment gateway integration takes longer than 13 story points estimated

**Probability**: High (60%)  
**Impact**: High (blocks MVP, blocks revenue)  
**Risk Score**: 20 (High × High)

**Root Cause**: Payment integrations notoriously complex, security sensitive, poor documentation

**Triggers to Watch**:
- Spike in Sprint 4 reveals unexpected complexity
- Payment gateway documentation lacking
- Security requirements more stringent than expected
- Multiple payment methods needed

**Proactive Mitigation**:
1. Schedule technical spike in Sprint 4 (before Sprint 5)
2. Research payment gateway in Sprint 3
3. Request API access in Sprint 3 (lead time)
4. Contract payment integration specialist for Sprint 5
5. Build abstraction layer to isolate payment logic
6. Use sandbox environment for early testing

**Reactive Mitigation** (if risk occurs):
1. Descope to single payment method initially
2. Add additional sprint if necessary
3. Increase contractor support
4. Simplify checkout flow to basics
5. Defer advanced payment features to post-MVP

**Contingency Plan**:
- Timeline: Add 1 sprint if needed (use Sprint 6 buffer)
- Budget: Contractor for 2 weeks instead of 1
- Scope: Defer Stripe + PayPal, do Stripe only
- Quality: Cannot compromise on payment security

**Owner**: Senior Dev + Contractor
**Status**: Open - Spike planned Sprint 4

### Risk Monitoring Process

**Weekly Risk Review** (in standup):
- Are any risk triggers occurring?
- Do we need to activate mitigation?
- Are new risks emerging?

**Sprint Retrospective Risk Review**:
- Which risks materialized?
- How effective was mitigation?
- Update risk register

**Risk Owner Responsibilities**:
- Monitor triggers
- Execute mitigation when needed
- Communicate status to team
- Update risk register
```

## Validation and Quality Checks

- [ ] High-risk tasks have mitigation plans
- [ ] MVP can be delivered on target date
```

### Sprint Plan Validation

```markdown
## Sprint Plan Quality Checklist

### Capacity Planning
- [ ] Team capacity calculated accurately
- [ ] Historical velocity considered
- [ ] Overhead and meetings accounted for (15-20%)
- [ ] PTO and holidays factored in
- [ ] Sprint commitments realistic (not over-committed)

### Sprint Goals
- [ ] Each sprint has clear, measurable goal
- [ ] Sprint goals align with MVP priorities
- [ ] Sprint deliverables are demonstrable
- [ ] Sprint success criteria defined

### Dependencies Respected

```

## Best Practices

### 1. Conservative Estimation
- **Under-promise, over-deliver**: Estimate conservatively, especially for first few sprints
- **Account for unknowns**: Add 10-20% buffer to tasks with uncertainty
- **Use historical data**: Base estimates on actual past performance, not idealized velocity
- **Include learning curve**: New tech or domain? Increase estimates 20-30% for first sprints

### 2. Dependency Management
- **Front-load dependencies**: Schedule blocking tasks early
- **Parallelize aggressively**: Find every opportunity for parallel work
- **External dependencies early**: Request access, APIs, credentials with lead time
- **De-risk critical path**: Put your best developers on critical path tasks

### 3. Sprint Planning
- **Sustainable pace**: Don't overcommit - burned out teams slow down
- **Demo-driven sprints**: Each sprint should produce something demonstrable
- **Leave slack**: Plan for 70-80% capacity, not 100%
- **Steady velocity**: Aim for consistent velocity sprint-to-sprint

### 4. Team Dynamics
- **Pair programming**: Use pairs for complex tasks, knowledge transfer
- **Cross-training**: Rotate developers across different areas
- **Junior growth**: Give juniors progressively harder tasks with support
- **Avoid single points of failure**: Multiple people should know each area

### 5. Continuous Adjustment
- **Measure velocity**: Track actual vs. estimated after each sprint
- **Adjust estimates**: If consistently over/under, recalibrate
- **Re-plan as needed**: Don't be rigid - adjust plan based on learnings
- **Retrospective insights**: Incorporate lessons learned into next sprint planning

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ **Over-optimization**: Don't spend weeks on perfect plan - plan is hypothesis, will change
  - Start with good-enough plan, adjust as you learn

- ❌ **Ignoring team capacity**: Planning more work than team can deliver
  - Use historical velocity, plan conservatively

- ❌ **Missing dependencies**: Not identifying blockers until you hit them
  - Map dependencies thoroughly upfront

- ❌ **Too-large tasks**: Tasks that take >1 week
  - Break down to 2-5 days max

- ❌ **No buffer**: Planning to 100% capacity with no slack
  - Plan to 70-80% capacity, leave room for unknowns

- ❌ **Skill mismatches**: Assigning complex tasks to juniors or vice versa
  - Match task complexity to developer experience

- ❌ **No risk planning**: Assuming everything goes perfectly
  - Identify risks, plan mitigation

## Interaction with Other Agents
