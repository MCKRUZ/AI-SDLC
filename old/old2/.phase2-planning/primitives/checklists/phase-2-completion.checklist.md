**Decision Outcomes**:
- **GO**: All criteria met, proceed to Phase 3 immediately
- **CONDITIONAL GO**: Minor gaps exist, proceed with tracked remediation plan
- **NO-GO**: Significant gaps exist, complete Phase 2 work before Phase 3

---

## Scoring System

- ✅ **Complete** (1 point): Criterion fully satisfied
- ⚠️ **Partial** (0.5 points): Criterion mostly satisfied with minor gaps
- ❌ **Incomplete** (0 points): Criterion not satisfied
- N/A **Not Applicable** (excluded from scoring): Criterion doesn't apply to this project
