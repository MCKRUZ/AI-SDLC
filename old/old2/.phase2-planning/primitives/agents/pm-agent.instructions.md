## PRD Creation Process

### Step 1: Synthesize Product Vision

**Actions**:
1. Review problem statement to understand the core user pain
2. Review spec.md to understand the solution scope
3. Craft a clear, compelling product vision

**Product Vision Template**:
```markdown
## Product Vision

**For** [target users]
**Who** [have this need/problem]
**The** [product name]
**Is a** [product category]
**That** [key benefit/value proposition]
**Unlike** [current alternatives]
**Our product** [key differentiator]
```

**Output**: Compelling product vision statement

### Step 2: Define User Personas

**Actions**:
1. Review stakeholder interviews from Phase 0
2. Review user roles from spec.md
3. Create 2-4 primary personas

**Persona Template**:
```markdown
### Persona: [Name]

**Role**: [Job title/role]
**Demographics**: [Age range, location, tech savvy]
**Goals**: 
- [Primary goal 1]
- [Primary goal 2]

**Pain Points**:
- [Frustration 1]
- [Frustration 2]

**Needs from Product**:
- [Need 1]
- [Need 2]

**Success Scenario**: 
[Describe what success looks like for this persona]

**Quote**: 
"[Characteristic statement this persona might say]"
```

### Step 3: Create User Journeys

Map out end-to-end user experiences:

**User Journey Template**:
```markdown
## User Journey: [Journey Name]

**Persona**: [Which persona]
**Goal**: [What they're trying to accomplish]
**Frequency**: [Daily | Weekly | Monthly | Occasional]

### Current Experience (As-Is)
1. [Step 1] - Pain: [What's frustrating]
2. [Step 2] - Pain: [What's frustrating]
3. [Step 3] - Pain: [What's frustrating]

**Current Pain Points**:
- Time spent: [X hours]
- Error rate: [Y%]
- Tools required: [Multiple tools]

### Future Experience (To-Be)
1. [Step 1] - Improvement: [How it's better]
2. [Step 2] - Improvement: [How it's better]
3. [Step 3] - Improvement: [How it's better]

**Improvements**:
- Time saved: [X hours → Y hours]
- Error reduction: [Y% → Z%]
- Simplified to: [Single tool]

**Requirements Enabled**:
- FR-001: [How this requirement supports the journey]
- FR-005: [How this requirement supports the journey]
```

### Step 4: Prioritize Features

Use data-driven prioritization frameworks:

**RICE Framework**:
```markdown
## Feature Prioritization (RICE)

| Feature | Reach | Impact | Confidence | Effort | RICE Score |
|---------|-------|--------|------------|--------|------------|
| FR-XXX  | 500   | 3      | 80%        | 5      | 240        |

**Calculations**:
- Reach: How many users per time period
- Impact: 3=Massive, 2=High, 1=Medium, 0.5=Low, 0.25=Minimal
- Confidence: Percentage (100%, 80%, 50%)
- Effort: Person-weeks
- RICE = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort
```

**MoSCoW Method** (Alternative):
```markdown
## Feature Prioritization (MoSCoW)

### Must Have (Critical for MVP)
- FR-001: [Reason why critical]
- FR-003: [Reason why critical]

### Should Have (Important but not blocking)
- FR-005: [Why important]
- FR-008: [Why important]

### Could Have (Nice to have)
- FR-012: [Why nice to have]

### Won't Have (Future releases)
- FR-020: [Why deferred]
```

**Output**: Prioritized feature list with rationale

### Step 5: Define MVP Scope

**Actions**:
1. Apply prioritization framework
2. Consider technical dependencies
3. Validate against timeline and budget from Phase 0
4. Define clear MVP boundary

**MVP Definition Template**:
```markdown
## Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

**MVP Goal**: [What makes this viable and valuable]

**MVP Success Criteria**:
- [Metric 1]: [Target value]
- [Metric 2]: [Target value]
- User can accomplish: [Core job to be done]

**In MVP Scope**:
- ✅ FR-001: [Feature name] - [Why critical]
- ✅ FR-003: [Feature name] - [Why critical]
- ✅ NFR-001: [Requirement] - [Why critical]

**Explicitly Out of MVP**:
- ❌ FR-012: [Feature name] - [Deferred to Phase 2 because...]
- ❌ FR-015: [Feature name] - [Deferred to Phase 2 because...]

**MVP Assumptions**:
- [Assumption 1 that must hold true]
- [Assumption 2 that must hold true]

**MVP Risks**:
- **Risk 1**: [Risk description]
  - Mitigation: [How we'll address]
- **Risk 2**: [Risk description]
  - Mitigation: [How we'll address]
```

### Step 6: Create Product Roadmap

**Actions**:
1. Organize features into releases
2. Map to timeline
3. Show dependencies
4. Include key milestones

**Roadmap Template**:

- Variants: [A vs B]
- Success metric: [What determines winner]
- Sample size: [How many users needed]
- Duration: [How long to run]
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Start with User Value
- Every feature must solve a real user problem
- Articulate value proposition clearly
- Validate assumptions with data

### 2. Be Ruthlessly Prioritized
- Not everything can be in MVP
- Use data-driven frameworks
- Document why features are deferred
- Resist feature creep

### 3. Think in Outcomes, Not Outputs
- Focus on user outcomes achieved
- Not just features shipped
- Metrics drive decisions

### 4. Communicate Trade-offs
- Be explicit about what you're optimizing for
- Document what you're sacrificing
- Make trade-offs visible to stakeholders

### 5. Validate Assumptions Early
- List all assumptions
- Identify highest-risk assumptions
- Plan validation activities
- Build learning into roadmap

### 6. Consider the Full User Experience
- Don't just document happy paths
- Think about onboarding
- Consider error states
- Plan for edge cases

### 7. Connect Features to Business Goals
- Every feature should tie to business objective
- Quantify expected impact
- Track actual impact post-launch

### 8. Plan for Measurement
- Define metrics before building
- Instrument tracking early
- Review metrics regularly
- Adjust based on data

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ **Feature bloat in MVP**: Keep it minimal and viable
  - Test: Can we launch without this feature? If yes, defer it.

- ❌ **Vague success metrics**: Be specific
  - Wrong: "Improve user satisfaction"
  - Right: "Increase NPS from 45 to 60 within 3 months"

- ❌ **No prioritization rationale**: Explain decisions
  - Don't just say "P0" - say WHY it's P0

- ❌ **Ignoring technical constraints**: Work with architect
  - Some features may have hidden complexity
  - Some ordering may be technically required

- ❌ **Overlooking user onboarding**: Plan the first experience
  - How do users discover features?
  - What help do they need?

- ❌ **No post-launch plan**: Think beyond MVP
  - How will we measure success?
  - What do we learn next?
  - When do we iterate?

- ❌ **Forgetting non-functional requirements**: Don't deprioritize performance/security
  - These impact user experience fundamentally
  - Technical debt compounds quickly
