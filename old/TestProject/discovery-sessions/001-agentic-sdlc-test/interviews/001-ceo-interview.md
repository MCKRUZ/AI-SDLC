## Opening Context

### Stakeholder's Perspective on the Problem

**Initial statement from Sarah**:

> "Our support team is drowning. We're losing customers because they can't get help fast enough. I see the metrics every week and it's getting worse as we grow. Last quarter we hit 8% monthly churn - that's unsustainable for a SaaS business. When I talk to churned customers, the number one complaint is 'I couldn't get answers when I needed them.' We have a great product, but if customers can't use it effectively, we lose them."

### How Long They've Experienced This Problem
"This has been building for about 18 months. When we were 400 customers, our support team could handle it. But we've doubled in size and our support processes haven't scaled. The problem became critical about 6 months ago when we crossed 700 customers."

### Frequency of Encounter
"I review support metrics every Monday. Every single week I see response times getting longer and customer satisfaction scores dropping. It's constant and getting worse."

---

## Interview Questions & Responses

### Question 1: What prompted you to prioritize this project right now?

**Interviewer**: "Help me understand what specifically made this a priority now versus 6 months ago?"

**Response**: 

> "Two things happened. First, our board meeting in December. They saw our churn numbers and made it clear this has to be fixed - it's hurting our valuation and our ability to raise the next round. Second, we lost a $200K annual contract in November. This was a customer who'd been with us for 2 years. They told us point-blank in the exit interview: 'Your product is great, but we can't afford to have our team blocked for 3-4 days waiting for support.' That hit me hard. We're losing revenue not because of product problems, but because of support problems."

**Follow-up Questions**:

**Q**: "You mentioned the board made it clear this needs fixing. What specific expectations did they set?"

**A**: "They want to see churn under 5% by Q3. That's our target. They also want to see improved NPS scores and faster support response times. The metric they care most about is Net Revenue Retention - we need to get back above 110%."

**Q**: "When you say 3-4 days for support, is that typical or an outlier?"

**A**: "That's our current average for first response. Some tickets get answered in a day, but complex technical questions can sit for a week. Our SLA says 24 hours, but we're missing it consistently."

**Key Insights**:
- Board pressure is significant - affects funding and valuation
- Lost a major customer specifically due to support issues
- Current performance (3-4 day response) violates stated SLA (24 hours)
- Target: Under 5% churn by Q3 2025 (6 months away)
- NPS and NRR are key metrics for board

### Question 2: Five Whys - Let's dig into the root cause

**Interviewer**: "You mentioned support response times are too slow. Why is this a problem?"

**Why #1**: **Why is slow support response a problem?**

**Response**: "Because customers get stuck. When they hit a technical issue or don't understand how to do something, they're blocked. If they're blocked for days, they lose productivity, get frustrated, and start questioning whether our software is worth the cost."

**Why #2**: **Why does being blocked lead to churn?**

**Response**: "Our customers use our software to run their businesses. If a project manager can't figure out how to set up a workflow, their entire team is affected. After being blocked a few times, they start looking for alternatives. The switching costs for project management software are high, but if we make people frustrated enough, they'll switch anyway. We're literally making it easy for our competitors."

**Why #3**: **Why can't the support team respond faster?**

**Response**: "They're overwhelmed. We have 8 support agents handling tickets from 800 customers. The math doesn't work. But it's not just volume - the support portal itself is terrible. Agents tell me they spend half their time hunting for information, copying and pasting responses, and dealing with the same questions over and over. They're working hard, but the tools make them inefficient."

**Why #4**: **Why is the support portal making agents inefficient?**

**Response**: "It's old technology from 2019. Back then we had 200 customers. It wasn't built to scale. There's no AI, no knowledge base integration, no suggested responses. Every ticket requires manual research and typing. Plus customers can't self-serve - there's no good way for them to find answers without submitting a ticket. So we're drowning in tickets that shouldn't need human intervention."

**Why #5**: **Why hasn't this been fixed before now?**

**Response**: "Honestly? We prioritized new features over support tooling. The engineering team has been focused on product development to win new customers. I approved those priorities. We thought we could scale support by just hiring more people. But we learned the hard way that you can't hire your way out of a process problem. Also, our last attempt at a major infrastructure project - the Enterprise Dashboard - failed. That made the team gun-shy about big initiatives. But now we don't have a choice."

**Root Cause Identified**: 

**Primary Root Cause**: Support portal built for 200 customers, now serving 800+ with no capability to scale (no AI, no self-service, no efficiency tooling)

**Secondary Root Cause**: Company prioritized new feature development over support infrastructure for 18 months

**Tertiary Root Cause**: Previous project failure created risk aversion to infrastructure improvements

---

### Question 3: What would success look like from your perspective?

**Interviewer**: "If this project succeeds, what will be different 6 months from now?"

**Response**:

> "Three things. First, our support response time is under 24 hours consistently - not as an exception, but as the norm. Second, our support team isn't constantly stressed and working overtime. They should be able to handle the load without heroics. Third, and most importantly, our churn rate is below 5%. When I talk to customers, I want to hear them say 'TechFlow support is responsive and helpful' instead of 'I couldn't get answers.'"

**Follow-up**: "How would you measure these?"

**Response**:

> "We track all of this in Zendesk and Salesforce now. For response time, it's straightforward - first response time on tickets. For support team health, I'd look at ticket volume per agent and overtime hours. For churn, we have exact numbers monthly. I'd also want to see NPS scores improve from 28 to at least 35."

**Key Insights**:
- Success is quantifiable: <24hr response time, <5% churn, NPS >35
- Support team wellness matters to her (mentions stress/overtime)
- Already tracking metrics in existing tools (Zendesk, Salesforce)
- Timeframe: 6 months to show improvement

---

### Question 4: What constraints should we be aware of?

**Interviewer**: "As we think about solving this, what constraints do we need to work within?"

**Response**:

> "Budget is tight but not impossible. We have about $400K for Q1 engineering spend, but that includes salaries. For a project like this, I could probably approve $100-150K if the business case is solid. Timeline is critical - we need to show progress by Q2. The board wants to see metrics improving. Also, we can't disrupt support operations. We need to keep helping customers while we fix the tooling. And it needs to integrate with our existing stack - we're committed to Azure and .NET."

**Follow-up**: "You mentioned previous project failure with the Enterprise Dashboard. How does that affect this initiative?"

**Response**:

> "That's actually why I'm insisting on proper discovery this time. With the dashboard, we jumped straight to building without really understanding the problem. We wasted 3 months and $200K before admitting it wasn't working. This time, I want us to be absolutely certain we understand the problem before we build anything. If that means spending 2-3 weeks on discovery, I'm fine with that. It's way cheaper than building the wrong thing."

**Key Insights**:
- Budget: ~$100-150K available (beyond salary costs)
- Timeline: Q1-Q2 for implementation, need progress by Q2
- Cannot disrupt ongoing support operations
- Must integrate with Azure/.NET stack
- CEO wants thorough discovery to avoid repeating past failure
- Previous $200K loss on failed project makes her risk-aware

## Five Whys Analysis Summary

**Initial Problem Statement**: "Support team is overwhelmed and customers are churning"

### Why #1: Why is this a problem?
**Response**: Customers get blocked and lose productivity when they can't get answers

### Why #2: Why does that matter?
**Response**: Being blocked repeatedly causes customers to evaluate competitors and eventually churn

### Why #3: Why is that significant?
**Response**: Support team can't respond faster - 8 agents for 800 customers, inefficient tools

### Why #4: Why does that create concern?
**Response**: Support portal from 2019 wasn't built for scale - no AI, no self-service, manual processes

### Why #5: Why is this a priority now?
**Response**: Company prioritized features over support tooling, now at crisis point with board pressure and major customer losses

**Root Cause Identified**: Outdated support infrastructure (built for 200 users, now serving 800+) combined with systematic underinvestment in support tooling

## Key Findings

### Explicit Requirements
Requirements directly stated by stakeholder:

1. "Support response time must be under 24 hours consistently" - Target: <24hr first response
2. "Churn must be below 5% by Q3" - Target: <5% monthly churn
3. "Solution must integrate with Azure and .NET stack" - Technical constraint
4. "Cannot disrupt ongoing support operations" - Implementation constraint
5. "Need to show progress by Q2" - Timeline constraint
6. "NPS needs to improve to at least 35" - Target: NPS >35

### Implicit Requirements
Requirements inferred from conversation but not directly stated:

1. **Scalability is critical**: System needs to handle 800 customers now and growth to 1,200+ by end of year
2. **Support team wellness matters**: Mentions stress, overtime - solution should reduce burden
3. **Self-service is important**: Mentioned customers can't find answers, implies need for knowledge base
4. **AI/automation expected**: Explicitly mentioned "no AI" as a gap in current system
5. **Risk mitigation required**: Given past project failure, needs strong validation before build
6. **ROI must be clear**: Budget is tight, needs solid business case

## Validation & Clarification

### Paraphrasing Validation

**You said**: "So if I'm understanding correctly, the core problem is that your support infrastructure can't scale - it was built when you had 200 customers, you now have 800, and it's causing both operational problems for your team and churn problems with customers. The board has given you a deadline of Q3 to show improvement, specifically getting churn under 5%."

**Stakeholder confirmed**: "Yes, exactly. That's the problem in a nutshell. And we can't keep hiring our way out of it - we need better tools."

**You said**: "And from a priority perspective, this is your top operational priority for Q1 because it's affecting your ability to raise your next funding round?"

**Stakeholder confirmed**: "Absolutely. If we can't show healthy unit economics and low churn, we won't get favorable terms on our Series C. This is business-critical."

### Ambiguities Clarified

| Vague Term Used | Clarification Obtained |
|-----------------|------------------------|
| "Overwhelmed" | 8 agents handling 800 customers, 200+ open tickets, consistent overtime |
| "Slow response" | 3-4 day average first response, violating 24-hour SLA |
| "Getting worse" | Churn increased from ~5% to 8% over past 6 months |
| "Old technology" | Support portal built in 2019 for 200 customers, now serving 800+ |
| "Board pressure" | Specific requirement: <5% churn by Q3 or affects Series C fundraising |
