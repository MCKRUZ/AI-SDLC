# Project Constitution

## Core Principles

[What guides all decisions? List 3-5 core principles]

## Quality Standards

### Code Quality

- [ ] Standard: [e.g., All public APIs must have documentation]
- [ ] Tool: [e.g., ESLint, SonarQube, StyleCop]
- [ ] Enforcement: [e.g., CI/CD pipeline blocks on violations]

### Testing

- [ ] Unit test coverage: [e.g., minimum 80%]
- [ ] Integration test coverage: [e.g., all API endpoints]
- [ ] E2E test coverage: [e.g., critical user paths]

### Performance

- [ ] Page load time: [e.g., < 2 seconds]
- [ ] API response time: [e.g., < 200ms for 95th percentile]
- [ ] Database query time: [e.g., < 100ms for read operations]

### Security

- [ ] Authentication: [e.g., OAuth 2.0 + JWT]
- [ ] Data encryption: [e.g., AES-256 at rest, TLS 1.3 in transit]
- [ ] Security scanning: [e.g., OWASP Top 10 compliance]

### Accessibility

- [ ] WCAG level: [e.g., AA compliance]
- [ ] Screen reader support: [e.g., Full support for JAWS/NVDA]

## Technical Constraints

[What are the non-negotiable constraints?]

- Platform: [e.g., Must run on Azure]
- Language: [e.g., Backend must be C#/.NET]
- Database: [e.g., Must use PostgreSQL]
- Compliance: [e.g., HIPAA, GDPR, SOC2]

## Decision-Making Framework

[How do we make technical decisions?]

### Process

1. Identify decision needed
2. Document options with pros/cons
3. Evaluate against constitution principles
4. Document decision and rationale
5. Review with team

### Criteria

- Alignment with core principles
- Meeting quality standards
- Within technical constraints
- Long-term maintainability
- Team capability
