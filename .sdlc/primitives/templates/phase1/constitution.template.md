## Usage Guidelines

### For Requirements Analysts
**Before writing any requirement, check**:
- Does it align with core principles?
- Does it support NFRs in this constitution?
- Does it respect all constraints?
- Does it conflict with any documented trade-off?

### For Architects
**Before making any architecture decision, check**:
- Does it support priority quality attributes?
- Does it respect technical constraints?
- Does it enable measurable NFRs?
- Does it require a new ADR?

### For Developers
**Before implementing any feature, check**:
- Does approach align with principles?
- Does it meet NFR targets?
- Does it respect constraints (stack, patterns, etc.)?
- Does it follow documented trade-off decisions?

### For Testers
**When validating the system, verify**:
- All NFRs are measurably met
- Quality attribute scenarios pass
- Constraints are respected
- No violations of documented principles
