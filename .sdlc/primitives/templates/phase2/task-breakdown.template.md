## High-Risk Tasks

### Technical Risk Assessment

| Task ID | Task Name | Risk Level | Risk Description | Mitigation Strategy |
|---------|-----------|------------|------------------|---------------------|
| INT-002 | Payment Integration | 🔴 High | Complex integration, PCI compliance | Early spike, use SDK, security review |
| BE-007 | Real-time Notifications | 🟡 Medium | SignalR/WebSocket complexity | Spike in Sprint 1, prototype early |
| FE-008 | Complex Data Visualization | 🟡 Medium | Performance with large datasets | Library evaluation spike, performance testing |
| OPS-005 | Production Deployment | 🟡 Medium | Infrastructure complexity | Practice deployments, runbook, rollback plan |

### Complexity Analysis

**High Complexity Tasks** (8+ story points):
1. **INT-002**: Payment Integration (13 points) - Third-party integration, security critical
2. **BE-007**: Real-time Notifications (8 points) - WebSocket complexity, scaling concerns
3. **FE-008**: Data Visualization (8 points) - Performance optimization, large data handling

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Conduct technical spikes before estimating
- Pair programming for complex tasks
- Extra code review for high-risk tasks
- Allocate senior developers to complex tasks

## Notes

### Using This Document

This task breakdown is a **living document** that should be:
- Updated as estimates are refined
- Adjusted based on actual velocity
- Enhanced with technical learnings
- Referenced during sprint planning
- Used for tracking overall progress

### Next Steps

1. **Review with team**: Conduct planning poker session to validate estimates
2. **Sprint planning**: Use this breakdown as input to sprint-planning.prompt.md
3. **Risk assessment**: Feed high-risk tasks into risk-assessment.prompt.md
4. **Architecture validation**: Ensure technical approach aligns with architecture.md
5. **Stakeholder review**: Present effort summary to stakeholders for approval
