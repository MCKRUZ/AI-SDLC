## Notes

[Additional comments, observations, or context about this phase completion review]

---

**Remember**: The goal of Phase 0 is to ensure Phase 1 proceeds without needing to revisit problem definition. If you're uncertain about any criteria, that's a signal to invest more time in discovery before proceeding.
