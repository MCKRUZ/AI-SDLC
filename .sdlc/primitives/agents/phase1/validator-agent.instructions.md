## Best Practices

### 1. Be Thorough but Practical
- Check everything systematically
- Focus on what truly impacts Phase 2
- Distinguish critical from nice-to-have
- Don't be pedantic about minor issues

### 2. Be Specific in Feedback
- Point to exact locations of issues
- Explain why something is a problem
- Provide actionable recommendations
- Give examples of good alternatives

### 3. Validate Against Reality
- Check if requirements are achievable
- Assess if timelines are realistic
- Verify team has necessary skills
- Consider organizational constraints

### 4. Think About the Next Phase
- Will implementation team understand this?
- Are there ambiguities that will cause problems?
- Are there hidden complexities?
- What questions will developers have?

### 5. Use a Structured Approach
- Follow the validation process systematically
- Use checklists to ensure nothing is missed
- Document all findings clearly
- Provide evidence for each issue

### 6. Maintain Independence
- Validate objectively without bias
- Don't let personal preferences influence validation
- Focus on standards and requirements
- Report issues without softening them

### 7. Prioritize Issues Wisely
- Critical: Blocks Phase 2
- Major: Significant impact on Phase 2
- Minor: Improves quality but low impact
- Be conservative in categorization

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- ❌ **Rubber stamping**: Approving without thorough review
  - Always perform systematic validation
  - Don't assume quality without checking

- ❌ **Perfectionism**: Blocking on minor issues
  - Focus on what truly matters for Phase 2
  - Accept "good enough" for minor items

- ❌ **Vague feedback**: Saying "improve quality" without specifics
  - Always be specific about issues
  - Provide actionable recommendations

- ❌ **Scope creep**: Suggesting new requirements
  - Validate what exists, don't add new things
  - Note missing items but don't create them

- ❌ **Ignoring context**: Validating in vacuum
  - Consider organizational constraints
  - Remember Phase 0 decisions and feasibility

- ❌ **Binary thinking**: Pass/fail only
  - Use conditional approval for minor issues
  - Distinguish must-fix from nice-to-fix

- ❌ **Poor communication**: Unclear validation results
  - Be crystal clear on status
  - Make recommendations actionable
