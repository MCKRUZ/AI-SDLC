## Interview Context

### Purpose of This Interview
Mike is the CTO and will need to approve any technical solution. We need to understand the technical constraints, what's been tried before, current architecture limitations, and engineering team capacity.

### Prior Context
From CEO interview we learned:
- Current support portal built in 2019 for 200 customers
- Now serving 800+ customers with scalability issues
- Budget: $100-150K available
- Timeline: Q3 board deadline
- Must integrate with Azure/.NET stack
- Previous Enterprise Dashboard project failed

### Framework Used
- [x] Five Whys
- [x] Jobs-to-be-Done
- [x] Open-ended exploration

## Opening Context

### Stakeholder's Perspective on the Problem

**Initial statement from Mike**:

> "Look, I'll be blunt - the support portal is technical debt that's been piling up for years. We built it quickly in 2019 when we needed something functional. It worked fine for a small customer base, but it's a classic case of 'we'll rebuild it later' that never happened. Now it's become a bottleneck. The code quality is poor, it's built on React 16 with outdated patterns, there's no real architecture - it's basically a prototype that went to production and never got refactored. Every time we try to add features, it takes longer because the foundation is shaky."

### How Long They've Experienced This Problem
"The portal has been inadequate for probably 12-18 months. But it became critical about 6 months ago when performance started degrading noticeably. Page load times increased, search became slow, the database queries aren't optimized. We've been band-aiding it, but you can only patch so much."

### Frequency of Encounter
"I hear about it constantly. Support team complains in #support-help Slack channel daily. My engineers get pulled into firefighting when things break. And I see the Sentry error reports - we're averaging 200-300 errors per day from that portal alone."

---

## Interview Questions & Responses

### Question 1: Walk me through the technical architecture of the current portal

**Interviewer**: "Help me understand what we're working with. What's the current technical stack and architecture?"

**Response**:

> "It's a React 16 SPA with a .NET Core 3.1 backend. Frontend is pretty standard - React Router, Redux for state management, though it's implemented inconsistently. Backend is a REST API with SQL Server database. We're hosted on Azure App Service. The biggest issues are:
> 
> 1. **No real-time capabilities** - Everything is request-response, no WebSockets or SignalR
> 2. **Inefficient search** - We're doing LIKE queries on SQL Server instead of using proper search infrastructure
> 3. **No caching strategy** - Every request hits the database
> 4. **Monolithic architecture** - Can't scale components independently
> 5. **No AI/ML integration** - Would require significant rearchitecture
> 6. **Poor mobile experience** - Not responsive, basically unusable on phones
> 7. **Technical debt in code** - About 30% test coverage, lots of duplicate code, no clear patterns"

**Follow-up**: "What have you tried to improve it?"

**Response**:

> "We've done some tactical fixes. Upgraded from .NET Core 3.1 to .NET 6 last year. Added some database indexes. Implemented rate limiting after we had some performance issues. But honestly, these are band-aids. The fundamental architecture needs rethinking. I've proposed a rewrite twice to Sarah, but we couldn't prioritize it against feature development. Now we're at a breaking point."

**Key Insights**:
- Technology is outdated (React 16, .NET Core 3.1 originally)
- Architecture was never designed for scale
- Multiple known technical gaps (search, caching, real-time, mobile)
- CTO has been aware and asking for resources for 12-18 months
- Band-aid fixes aren't working anymore

---

### Question 2: Five Whys - Why hasn't this been fixed before?

**Why #1**: **Why hasn't the portal been rebuilt before now?**

**Response**: "Resource prioritization. We have 25 engineers and they've been focused on shipping features that drive revenue. New customer acquisition has been the priority, not existing customer support tools. Every time I brought up rebuilding the support portal, it got deprioritized for a revenue-generating feature."

**Why #2**: **Why was revenue prioritization more important than support infrastructure?**

**Response**: "That's how SaaS companies typically work - you grow by acquiring customers. The thinking was 'we need to reach 1,000 customers to raise our Series C.' Nobody wants to tell investors 'we spent 6 months improving internal tools.' But there's a false economy here. If you churn customers as fast as you acquire them, you're not actually growing. We learned that the hard way."

**Why #3**: **Why did that false economy persist so long?**

**Response**: "Because the pain was felt by support team, not by product or engineering directly. When support complained, we'd throw a few dev days at fixing specific bugs, but never addressed the systemic problem. The engineering team was measured on feature velocity, not on support team efficiency. It wasn't until churn numbers started affecting the company's valuation that leadership connected the dots."

**Why #4**: **Why wasn't engineering measured on support team efficiency?**

**Response**: "Classic organizational silo problem. Product and engineering are measured on shipping features and reducing bugs in the main product. Customer Success owns support metrics. But Customer Success doesn't have engineering resources - they depend on us. There was no shared ownership of the support experience until very recently. Sarah only started making this a shared KPI last quarter after the board meeting."

**Why #5**: **Why is this a priority now when it wasn't before?**

**Response**: "Three reasons. First, the board made it clear - fix churn or we can't raise Series C at good terms. That's existential. Second, we lost the $200K customer, which was a wake-up call. Third, I finally have data to prove the business impact. I've been tracking every hour my engineers spend firefighting support portal issues - last quarter it was 120 hours across the team. That's 3 weeks of engineering time wasted on emergency patches. I took that to Sarah and she agreed we need to fix the root cause."

**Root Cause Identified**: 

**Primary Root Cause**: Organizational misalignment - engineering measured on feature velocity, support owned customer success, no shared ownership of support experience until crisis point

**Secondary Root Cause**: Resource prioritization model that optimized for customer acquisition over customer retention

**Tertiary Root Cause**: Technical debt allowed to accumulate because support team pain wasn't visible to leadership until it impacted revenue

### Question 3: What do you think the solution should look like technically?

**Interviewer**: "If you had a blank slate, what would you build?"

**Response**:

> "Okay, this is where I've done some thinking. I don't think we need to rebuild from scratch - that would take 6+ months and blow the budget. What I'd propose is a phased approach:
>
> **Phase 1 (Q1-Q2)**: Foundation improvements
> - Upgrade to React 18 with modern patterns
> - Implement proper search using Azure Cognitive Search
> - Add Redis caching layer
> - Integrate GPT-4 for suggested responses and article recommendations
> - Fix the worst UX issues
> 
> **Phase 2 (Q3)**: Scale improvements
> - Add real-time capabilities with SignalR
> - Build proper mobile experience
> - Implement agent assist features
> - Add analytics and reporting
>
> **Phase 3 (Q4)**: Advanced features
> - Customer self-service portal
> - AI-powered triage
> - Knowledge base integration
> - Proactive support features
>
> But here's the thing - I need to validate this with the support team. What I think will help might not be what they actually need. That's why I'm glad we're doing proper discovery."

**Follow-up**: "What's your confidence level that this can be done in the timeline and budget?"

**Response**:

> "For Phase 1? About 70% confident. The tech is straightforward - we've done Azure Cognitive Search integrations before, we know Redis, and OpenAI integration is well-documented. The risk is scope creep and requirements churn. That's what killed the Enterprise Dashboard project. We kept changing what we were building because we never really understood what customers needed.
>
> For the full three phases? That's a 12-month program that would cost probably $400-500K in engineering time plus infrastructure. But if we focus just on Phase 1 and prove it works, we can get budget approved for the rest based on results."

**Key Insights**:
- CTO has thought through technical approach (phased, incremental)
- Wants to validate assumptions with support team (learned from past failures)
- Phase 1 could fit timeline (Q1-Q2) and budget ($100-150K)
- Main risk is scope creep and requirements changes
- Needs to prove value to unlock budget for later phases

---

### Question 4: What are the technical constraints and risks?

**Interviewer**: "What technical constraints do we need to work within, and what keeps you up at night about this project?"

**Response on Constraints**:

> "Constraints are pretty clear:
> 
> 1. **Must stay on Azure** - We have an EA agreement, and everything's Azure-native
> 2. **Must use .NET backend** - That's our team's expertise, don't want to introduce new languages
> 3. **Can't take current portal offline** - Need parallel development or feature flagging
> 4. **Must integrate with Zendesk** - That's where all the tickets live
> 5. **Must maintain security/compliance** - We're SOC 2 certified, can't compromise that
> 6. **Limited engineering bandwidth** - Can probably dedicate 2-3 engineers max without killing feature velocity"

**Response on Risks**:

> "Here's what worries me:
>
> **Risk 1: Requirements instability** - If we don't nail down what we're building, we'll churn. That's what killed the last project.
>
> **Risk 2: Integration complexity** - Zendesk integration might be harder than it looks. Their API is comprehensive but not always well-documented.
>
> **Risk 3: Performance at scale** - We're building for 800 customers now, but we'll hit 1,200 by end of year. Need to design for that.
>
> **Risk 4: AI consistency** - If we're using GPT-4 for suggestions, we need to make sure it's giving good advice. Bad AI suggestions would make things worse.
>
> **Risk 5: Team capacity** - If we pull 2-3 engineers, will feature velocity suffer enough that we create a different problem?
>
> **Risk 6: Support team adoption** - If we build something they don't like or don't use, it's wasted effort."

**Follow-up**: "Which of those risks is highest priority to mitigate?"

**Response**:

> "Requirements instability, hands down. That's the one that's killed us before. If we can get rock-solid requirements from this discovery phase, the rest is engineering execution, which we're good at. But if requirements keep changing, no amount of good engineering can save the project."

**Key Insights**:
- Technical constraints are clear and well-understood
- Six major risks identified, requirements instability is #1
- Team capacity is limited (2-3 engineers max)
- Integration with Zendesk is a known complexity
- Support team adoption is a concern (learned from past)
- CTO sees discovery phase as critical to success

### Question 5: What happened with the Enterprise Dashboard project?

**Interviewer**: "You mentioned the Enterprise Dashboard failure. What can we learn from that?"

**Response**:

> "That was painful. We spent 3 months building an enterprise-level analytics dashboard for large customers. Looked beautiful, technically sophisticated. Problem was, we never validated what data those customers actually wanted to see. We built what we *thought* they wanted. When we showed it to them, they said 'this is nice, but where's the data on X and Y?' We realized we'd have to rebuild 60% of it. At that point, Sarah made the call to cut our losses.
>
> The lessons:
> 1. **Talk to users before building anything** - Obvious in hindsight, but we skipped it
> 2. **Start with MVPs and iterate** - We tried to build the perfect solution upfront
> 3. **Validate technical assumptions early** - We assumed some data integrations would be easy, they weren't
> 4. **Get sign-off at checkpoints** - We didn't show progress until we were 'done'
> 5. **Know when to kill a project** - Sarah made the right call to stop throwing good money after bad
>
> For this project, I want to do the opposite. Talk to support team extensively. Build the smallest thing that could help. Validate it works before building more. Show progress weekly. Be willing to pivot if we learn something new."

**Key Insights**:
- Previous failure was caused by lack of user validation
- CTO deeply learned from this experience
- Now advocates for extensive discovery, MVPs, iteration, validation
- Wants weekly progress reviews and willingness to pivot
- Support team validation is top priority

## Jobs-to-be-Done Analysis

### The Job the CTO is Trying to Do

**Primary Job**: Build a support portal that enables support team to help customers efficiently while being maintainable by engineering team

**Current Solution/Workaround**: Band-aid fixes, emergency patches, firefighting when things break

**Pain Points with Current Approach**:
1. Reactive instead of proactive - always firefighting
2. Engineering time wasted on maintenance instead of new features
3. Code quality degrading further with each emergency patch
4. Support team stays frustrated despite engineering efforts
5. No clear path to improvement within current architecture

**What Success Would Look Like**:
> "Success for me is: Support team stops complaining about the tools. Error rates drop significantly. My engineers aren't pulled into firefighting every week. We have a modern, maintainable codebase that we can iterate on. And most importantly, the solution actually moves the churn needle - otherwise all this work doesn't matter."

**Constraints Working Within**:
- Limited engineering capacity (2-3 developers)
- Azure/.NET tech stack
- SOC 2 compliance requirements
- Can't disrupt current operations
- Need results by Q2 to show board
